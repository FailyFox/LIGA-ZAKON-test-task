PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT
(To Prospectus dated November 12, 1996)
 
$61,400,000
 
MOBIL CORPORATION
 
1997-C PASS THROUGH TRUST
 
6.69% PASS THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 1997-C
 
Each Pass Through Certificate offered hereby will represent a fractional
undivided interest in the 1997-C Pass Through Trust (the "Pass Through Trust")
to be formed pursuant to a Pass Through Trust Agreement and Pass Through Trust
Supplement (together, the "Agreement") among Mobil Corporation ("Mobil"),
Mobil Equipment Finance Company Inc. ("MEFC" or the "Charterer") and State
Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Pass Through Trustee"), as trustee of the
Pass Through Trust. The property of the Pass Through Trust will consist of two
secured notes (the "Secured Notes") issued separately on a nonrecourse basis
by two Owner Trusts (as defined herein) pursuant to two separate lease
transactions to finance not more than 80% of the cost of each such Owner
Trust's interest in one of two double-hulled LR1 class crude oil tank vessels
of approximately 105,500 dead weight tons capacity (the "Vessels"), title to
each of which will be acquired by the U.K. Lessor (as defined herein) from the
builder thereof. Each Vessel will be leased by the U.K. Lessor to one of the
Owner Trusts, which will, in turn, charter such Vessel to the Charterer.
Although neither the Pass Through Certificates nor the Secured Notes are
direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, the Charterer or Mobil, the amounts
unconditionally payable by the Charterer for Assigned Hire (as defined herein)
of the related Vessel pursuant to the related charter, which amounts are
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Mobil pursuant to two separate
guaranties each relating to one of the charters (each a "Parent Guaranty") and
assigned to the Indenture Trustee, will be at least sufficient to pay in full
when due all scheduled payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Secured Notes.
The Pass Through Trust will purchase the Secured Notes which, after the
accretion of discount and the payment of interest, if any, as more
particularly set forth below, will have an interest rate corresponding to the
interest rate applicable to the Pass Through Certificates. The maturity dates
of the Secured Notes will be the final distribution date applicable to the
Pass Through Certificates. The Secured Notes will be secured by, among other
things, an assignment of certain rights under the Charter relating to each
Vessel, including the right to receive Assigned Hire payable in respect
thereof. For circumstances under which distributions to the Certificateholders
may be made prior to the final distribution date, see "Description of the Pass
Through Certificates--Payments and Distributions."
The Secured Notes will be purchased by the Pass Through Trust at a discount
from par and, during the period from the closing of the public offering of the
Pass Through Certificates to and including March 31, 2000, will provide a
return consisting of accretion of discount such that the yield to and
including March 31, 2000 of each Secured Note will equal the semi-annual bond
equivalent rate corresponding to the interest rate per annum applicable to
such Pass Through Certificates. From and after April 1, 2000, all of the
Secured Notes will accrue interest, payable in cash on January 2 and July 2 of
each year. Principal and all cash interest payments on the Secured Notes held
in the Pass Through Trust will be passed through to the Certificateholders in
scheduled amounts on January 2 and July 2 in each year, commencing July 2,
2000. The Proceeds to Pass Through Trustee shown below equals the sum of the
prices at which the Secured Notes will be sold to the Pass Through Trust upon
original issue, as described above.
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION NOR HAS THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE
ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT OR THE PROSPECTUS. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

    underwriting commission, and certain other expenses estimated at $900,000,
    will be payable by the Owner Trusts in the lease transactions. The
    proceeds from the sale of the Pass Through Certificates will be used to
    purchase the Secured Notes from the Owner Trusts. Mobil and MEFC have
    agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against certain liabilities under the
    Securities Act. See "Underwriting."
The Pass Through Certificates are offered by the Underwriter, subject to prior

                              will become effective at the time of the closing
                              of the Offering.

                              corresponding to the interest rate per annum
                              applicable to the Pass Through Certificates. From

Security for the Secured      Each Secured Note will be secured by, among other
 Notes......................  things, (i) an assignment of certain of the
                              related Owner Trust's rights under the related
                              Charter, including the right to receive Assigned
                              Hire (as defined herein), (ii) an assignment of
                              such Owner Trust's rights (other than such Owner
                              Trust's right to receive Excess Hire (except in
                              the case of an Indenture Event of Default) and

                USE OF PROCEEDS AND OUTLINE OF THE TRANSACTION
 
  The Pass Through Certificates are being issued and sold in order to finance
the cost to the Owner Trusts of their respective interests in two oil tankers
and to facilitate transactions whereby such tankers will be chartered on a
long-term basis to the Charterer. The Vessels will be double-hulled, double-
bottomed, LR1 crude oil tank vessels, each of approximately 105,500 dead
weight tons capacity. Title to each Vessel will be held by the U.K. Lessor and
the U.K. Lessor will lease such Vessels, separately, to an owner trust (each,
an "Owner Trust") created under the Delaware Business Trust Act for the
benefit of QM Tanker Co. LLC (the "Owner Participant") under a separate
Declaration and Agreement of Trust dated November 19, 1997, among Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell (Cayman) Limited, as managing trustee (the "Managing
Trustee"), Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware
Trustee" and, together with the Managing Trustee, the "Owner Trustees") and
such Owner Participant. The Owner Participant is a limited life company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and is owned 50% by a Mobil
affiliate and 50% by a third party investor.
 
  The Vessels are contracted for delivery to the U.K. Lessor pursuant to two
separate construction contracts with the Builder, each dated November 24, 1997
(collectively, the "Construction Contracts"). The Vessels will be constructed
in the Builder's shipyard at Ulsan, Korea, and are expected to be delivered in
the fourth quarter of 1999. The all-in costs payable to the Builder under the
related Construction Contract and to the related supervisory agent under the
Supervisory Agreement (as defined herein) are expected to be approximately
$42.6 million for each Vessel. The U.K. Lessor has agreed to pay these amounts
for each Vessel in installments. Certain incidental additional costs,
including costs for outfitting each Vessel, will be paid upon the delivery of
such Vessel. Title to each Vessel will be delivered to the U.K. Lessor upon
payment of the final installment to the Builder and acceptance of the Vessel
by or on behalf of the U.K. Lessor under the related Construction Contract.
 
  Each Owner Trust has entered into a lease financing arrangement whereby such
Owner Trust will lease the related Vessel from the U.K. Lessor pursuant to a
head lease (each, a "Head Lease"). The term of each Head Lease will expire on
or after the maturity date of the Secured Note issued in respect of the
Charter for the related Vessel. Each Head Lease provides the related Owner
Trust with certain benefits in the related Vessel including, but not limited
to, the right to use and possession of the Vessel, the right to charter the
Vessel and, upon termination of the Head Lease and sale of the Vessel, the
right to receive, after the payment of certain amounts determined by reference
to the Secured Notes (as described below under "The U.K. Financing--Head
Lease") and certain amounts payable to the U.K. Lessor under the related Head
Lease, the residual value of the Vessel by way of rebate of rentals or sales
agency commission.
 
  Each Owner Trust will finance not more than 80% of the cost of such Owner
Trust's interest in the related Vessel through the issuance of a Secured Note
pursuant to the related Indenture. The Secured Note with respect to each
Vessel will be acquired, in turn, by the Pass Through Trustee, on behalf of
the Pass Through Trust, which will finance its acquisition of such Secured
Note through the issuance to the public of the Pass Through Certificates being
offered hereby (the "Offering"). The remainder of the cost of each Owner
Trust's interest in the related Vessel will be provided by an equity
investment by the Owner Participant, which will be approximately $13 million
per Vessel. The proceeds of the related Secured Note and the related equity
investment by the Owner Participant will be held by the related Owner Trust or
the Owner Participant and used in connection with the U.K. Financing as
provided below.
 
  Under the U.K. Financing, the U.K. Lessor will have the benefit of certain
security, including the Head Lease Support Letter of Credit (as defined
herein) issued by the Head Lease Support Bank (as defined herein) and which
will be available for the payment of significant portions of the rent and
other
 
                                     S-12

 
sums payable by the Owner Trust under such Head Lease. In November 1997, the
U.K. Lessor executed the Construction Contracts and the Supervisory Agreements
in respect of the Vessels and paid the first installments payable to the
Builder and the supervisory agent pursuant to the Construction Contracts and
the Supervisory Agreements, respectively. Immediately following the closing of
the Offering, each Owner Trust will deposit more than three-quarters of the
net proceeds of the sale of the related Secured Note with the Head Lease
Support Bank, which will then issue a notice to the U.K. Lessor confirming
that, effective on the date of such notice, the related Head Lease Support
Letter of Credit is in full force and effect and available as required by the
U.K. Documents. On each date subsequent installment payments are due under the
applicable Construction Contract and Supervisory Agreement, the related Owner
Trust will make a further deposit with the Head Lease Support Bank, whereupon
the Head Lease Support Bank will increase the maximum amount available under
the related Head Lease Support Letter of Credit and will notify the U.K.
Lessor of such increase. The U.K. Lessor will then remit the installments to
the Builder and the supervisory agent under the Supervisory Agreement. During
the term of the Head Lease, following the issue of the notice referred to
above, the Head Lease Support Letter of Credit will be available for the
payment of rentals and other amounts due from the related Owner Trust under
the Head Lease.
 
  Each Owner Trust will charter its interest in the related Vessel, including
its leasehold interest under the related Head Lease (a "Vessel Interest"), to
the Charterer pursuant to a Bareboat Charter Party (the "Charter"). Mobil will
enter into separate Parent Guaranties pursuant to which it will irrevocably
and unconditionally guarantee all obligations of the Charterer under the
related Charter and the related Operative Documents.

                              DIAGRAM OF PAYMENTS
 
  The following diagram illustrates certain aspects of the ongoing payment
flows in this transaction among Mobil, the Charterer, each Owner Trust, each
Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee and the Certificateholders.
 
  With respect to each Vessel, the Charterer will charter the related Vessel
Interest from the related Owner Trust under the related Charter, pursuant to
which the Charterer will pay charter hire and certain other amounts to such
Owner Trust. The Secured Note issued by such Owner Trust under the related
Indenture will be secured by certain rights in the related Vessel Interest and
by an assignment to the related Indenture Trustee of the Charter (other than
Excepted Payments) and the related Parent Guaranty. As a result of the
assignment of each Charter, the Charterer will pay a portion of the charter
hire equal to the amount of debt service on the related Secured Note directly
to the related Indenture Trustee, who, in turn, will apply such payments to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the related Secured Note
issued under the related Indenture and held in the Pass Through Trust. The
balance of payments under such Charter will be paid to the related Owner Trust
for the benefit of the Owner Participant. The Pass Through Trustee will
distribute to Certificateholders all payments received in respect of the
Secured Notes held in the Pass Through Trust, including payments, if any, made
by Mobil under the Parent Guaranties.

                 DESCRIPTION OF THE PASS THROUGH CERTIFICATES
 
  The Pass Through Certificates offered hereby will be issued by the Pass
Through Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The following summary
of the particular terms of the Pass Through Certificates supplements and, to
the extent inconsistent therewith, replaces the description of the general
terms and provisions of the Pass Through Certificates set forth in the
accompanying Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Certificates."
The statements under this caption are a summary and do not purport to be
complete. This summary makes use of terms defined in, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to all of, the provisions of the Basic Agreement, a form
of which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of which
the accompanying Prospectus is a part, and to all of the provisions of the
Trust Supplement which, together with the forms of the related Participation
Agreements, Secured Notes, Indentures, Charters, Parent Guaranties and Trust
Agreements, will be filed by Mobil with the Commission as exhibits to a
Current Report on Form 8-K. This summary should be read in conjunction with
the statements under the caption "Description of the Certificates" in the
accompanying Prospectus.
 
PAYMENTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
 
  The Pass Through Certificates will be issued in fully registered form and
will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of The Depository
Trust Company. No person acquiring an interest in the Pass Through
Certificates will be entitled to receive a definitive certificate representing
such person's interest in the Pass Through Trust unless definitive
certificates are issued under the limited circumstances described under the
caption "Description of the Certificates--Book-Entry Registration--Definitive
Certificates" in the accompanying Prospectus.
 
  Payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Secured Notes
held in the Pass Through Trust will be distributed by the Pass Through Trustee
to Certificateholders on each Regular Distribution Date and each Special
Distribution Date as described in the following two paragraphs, except in
certain cases when some or all of the Secured Notes are in default. See
"Description of the Certificates--Events of Default and Certain Rights upon an
Event of Default" in the accompanying Prospectus. Interest paid on the Secured
Notes will be passed through to the Certificateholders on January 2 and July 2
of each year, commencing on July 2, 2000, until the final distribution date
for the Pass Through Trust (each, a "Regular Distribution Date"). Payments of
principal on the Secured Notes are scheduled to be received by the Pass
Through Trustee on January 2 or July 2, or both, in certain years, commencing
July 2, 2000, depending upon the terms of the Secured Notes (such scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the Secured Notes are herein referred to
as "Scheduled Payments"). Scheduled Payments of principal on the Secured Notes
held in the Pass Through Trust are set forth in "Appendix B" in this
Prospectus Supplement.
 
  The Pass Through Trustee will distribute on each Regular Distribution Date
all Scheduled Payments the receipt of which is confirmed by the Pass Through
Trustee on such date. Each Certificateholder will be entitled to receive a pro
rata share of any distribution in respect of Scheduled Payments of principal
and interest made on the Secured Notes. Each such distribution in respect of
Scheduled Payments will be made by the Pass Through Trustee to the holders of
record of the Certificates on the 15th day preceding such Regular Distribution
Date, subject to certain exceptions. If a Scheduled Payment is not received by
the Pass Through Trustee on a Regular Distribution Date but is received within
five days thereafter, it will be distributed on the date so received by the
Pass Through Trustee to such holders of record. If it is received after such
five day period, it will be treated as a Special Payment and distributed as
described below.
 
  Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest received by the Pass
Through Trustee on account of the early redemption, if any, of the Secured
Notes, and payments received by the Pass Through Trustee following a default
in respect of the Secured Notes relating to one or more Vessels
 
                                     S-15

 
(including payments received by the Pass Through Trustee on account of the
purchase by an Owner Trust of the related Secured Note, the sale by the Pass
Through Trustee of one or more Secured Notes or the exercise of remedies under
the related Indenture by the Indenture Trustee) ("Special Payments") will be
distributed on, in the case of an early redemption or a purchase, the date of
such early redemption or purchase, which shall be a Business Day, and
otherwise, except as described in the next paragraph, 20 days after the Pass
Through Trustee has confirmed receipt of the funds for such Special Payment
(or the next Business Day after such 20th day if such date is not a Business
Day) (each, a "Special Distribution Date"). The Pass Through Trustee will mail
notice to the Certificateholders not less than 20 days prior to the Special
Distribution Date on which any Special Payment is scheduled to be distributed
by the Pass Through Trustee stating such anticipated Special Distribution
Date. Each distribution of a Special Payment, other than the final
distribution, on a Special Distribution Date will be made by the Pass Through
Trustee to the Certificateholders of record on the 15th day next preceding
such Special Distribution Date. See "Description of the Secured Notes--
Prepayments" in this Prospectus Supplement and "Description of the
Certificates--Events of Default and Certain Rights upon an Event of Default"
in the accompanying Prospectus.
 
  In the event that as a result of unforeseen circumstances, all of the
proceeds from the sale of the Pass Through Certificates are not used to
purchase the Secured Notes on the Closing Date, such Secured Notes may be
purchased by the Pass Through Trustee at any time on or prior to December 12,
1997. In such event, the Pass Through Trustee will hold such proceeds from the
sale of the Pass Through Certificates that are not used to purchase Secured
Notes in an escrow account pending the completion of arrangements to purchase
the Secured Notes not so purchased. Such proceeds will be invested in certain
specified investments having maturity dates in no event later than December
12, 1997 at the discretion and risk of, and for the account of, the Charterer.
The Charterer will be responsible for any losses on such investments. To the
extent that any amount of the proceeds from the sale of any Pass Through
Certificates held in the escrow account referred to above is not used to
purchase Secured Notes on or prior to December 12, 1997, such amount will be
distributed by the Pass Through Trustee to the holders of record of the Pass
Through Certificates on a pro rata basis upon not less than 20 days' prior
notice to them as a Special Payment. The Special Payment will be made on a
Special Distribution Date not later than January 2, 1998, together with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate applicable to such Pass Through
Certificates, but without premium. The Charterer will pay to the Pass Through
Trustee on the Special Distribution Date an amount equal to such interest.
 
POOL FACTORS
 
  Unless there has been an early redemption or a purchase of one or more of
the Secured Notes by the related Owner Trust or Owner Participant after an
Indenture Event of Default, or a default in the payment of principal in
respect of one or more of the Secured Notes, the Pool Factor for the Pass
Through Trust (i) will decline in proportion to the scheduled repayments of
principal on the Secured Notes and (ii) will increase in proportion to the
accretion of discount on the Secured Notes. In the event of such redemption,
purchase or default, the Pool Factor and the Pool Balance of the Pass Through
Trust will be recomputed after giving effect thereto and notice thereof will
be mailed to the Certificateholders.
 
  The "Pool Balance" indicates, as of any Regular Distribution Date or Special
Distribution Date, the aggregate unpaid principal amount (including accretion
of discount) of the Secured Notes held in the Pass Through Trust on such date
plus any amounts in respect of principal on such Secured Notes held by the
Pass Through Trustee and not yet distributed. The Pool Balance as of any
Regular Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date shall be computed after
giving effect to the payment of principal, if any, of the Secured Notes and
the distribution thereof to be made on that date and the accretion of discount
to such date.
 
                                     S-16

 
  The "Pool Factor" for the Pass Through Trust as of any Regular Distribution
Date or Special Distribution Date is the quotient (rounded to the tenth
decimal place, with .00000000005 being rounded upwards) computed by dividing
(i) the then outstanding Pool Balance by (ii) the original aggregate principal
amount (including the full accretion of discount) of the Pass Through
Certificates. The Pool Factor as of any Regular Distribution Date or Special
Distribution Date shall be computed after giving effect to the payment of
principal, if any, on the Secured Notes and distribution thereof to be made on
that date and the accretion of discount to such date. The Pool Factor will
initially be 0.8581128020; thereafter, the Pool Factor will change as
described above to reflect changes in the Pool Balance. The amount of a
Certificateholder's pro rata share of the Pool Balance of the Pass Through
Trust can be determined by multiplying the original denomination of such
holder's Certificate by the Pool Factor as of the applicable Regular
Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date. A report setting forth the
Pool Factor and the Pool Balance will be mailed by the Pass Through Trustee to
Certificateholders on each Regular Distribution Date and Special Distribution
Date.

  As of the date of issuance by the Pass Through Trustee of the Pass Through
Certificates and assuming that all proceeds are used to purchase Secured Notes
on or before December 12, 1997 and that no early redemption, default or

                       DESCRIPTION OF THE SECURED NOTES
 
  The following summary of the particular terms and provisions of the Secured
Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent therewith replaces, the
description of the general terms and provisions of the Secured Notes set forth
in the accompanying Prospectus under the heading "Description of the Secured
Notes." The statements under this caption are summaries and do not purport to
be complete. The summaries relate to, and make use of terms defined in and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to all of the provisions of, the
Secured Notes, the Indentures, the Charters, the Parent Guaranties, the
Participation Agreements and the Trust Agreements, forms of which will be
filed by Mobil with the Commission as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-
K. The summaries should be read in conjunction with the statements under the
heading "Description of the Secured Notes" in the accompanying Prospectus.
Prior to or concurrently with the issuance of the Pass Through Certificates,
the Charterer, the Owner Participant, the related Owner Trust, Managing
Trustee and Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee shall have entered
into a Participation Agreement with respect to each Vessel, and the related
Owner Participant, Managing Trustee and Delaware Trustee are parties to a
Trust Agreement relating to such Vessel. Each Participation Agreement
contemplates that, on or after the date of issuance of the Pass Through
Certificates, a Charter and an Indenture will be executed and delivered in a
form prescribed therein and a Secured Note will be issued in the form
prescribed in such Indenture.
 
GENERAL
 
  The Secured Note with respect to each Vessel will be issued under a separate
Indenture between the related Owner Trust and State Street Bank and Trust
Company, as Indenture Trustee.
 
  Each Owner Trust will demise charter the related Vessel Interest to the
Charterer pursuant to the related Charter. Under each Charter, the Charterer
is obligated to make payments of hire and other amounts payable under the
related Operative Documents to the related Owner Trust. Each Owner Trust's
right to receive certain of the payments under the related Charter and other
amounts payable under the related Operative Documents (other than Excepted
Payments) has been assigned under the related Indenture to the related
Indenture Trustee. Pursuant to the terms of each Indenture, at any time until
an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Charterer
will pay only Base Hire, Termination Value and certain other amounts of
Supplemental Hire described below ("Assigned Hire") directly to the related
Indenture Trustee. Assigned Hire under each Charter will be sufficient to pay
in full scheduled payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the related Secured Note. Assigned Hire payments received by the related
Indenture Trustee will be distributed to the Pass Through Trustee to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the related Secured Note held
in the Pass Through Trust, which payments in turn will be distributed by the
Pass Through Trustee to the Certificateholders on the date receipt thereof is
confirmed by the Pass Through Trustee. The Charterer will pay all other
amounts payable under the related Charter directly to the related Owner Trust
for distribution to the related Owner Participant or as otherwise provided in
the related Operative Documents. The Secured Note issued under each Indenture
is not a direct obligation of, or guaranteed by, the Charterer or Mobil. The
Charterer's obligations under the each Charter and the other related Operative
Documents to which it is a party are general obligations of the Charterer and
are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Mobil under the related
Parent Guaranty.
 
  Under each Charter, Base Hire is an amount that is at least sufficient to
pay the scheduled semi-annual installments of principal and interest due and
payable on the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. Following an
Event of Loss to a Vessel or an early termination of the related Charter, the
Charterer will pay directly to the related Indenture Trustee an amount which
is at least sufficient, together with other amounts then due under such
Charter, to pay in full as of the date of
 
                                     S-19

 
such payment the aggregate unpaid principal of the related Secured Note,
together with all unpaid interest thereon accrued to such date of payment
("Termination Value"). In addition to Base Hire and Termination Value, the
Charterer is also obligated under each Charter and the related Indenture to
pay directly to the related Indenture Trustee that portion of Supplemental
Hire consisting of premium, if any (except premium, if any, payable by the
related Owner Participant or the related Owner Trust in connection with an
election by such Owner Participant or Owner Trust to purchase or redeem the
related Secured Note upon the occurrence of a related Charter Event of
Default), and interest on overdue payments due to the related Indenture
Trustee or any amounts payable to such Indenture Trustee for its services,
expenses or indemnification.
 
PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS
 
  The Maturity Date of each Secured Note will be January 2, 2018. The
aggregate principal amounts (including full accretion of discount) of the
Secured Notes to be issued under the Indentures related to Hull No. 1177 and
Hull No. 1178 will be $30,700,000 and $30,700,000, respectively.
 
  Interest on each Secured Note will be payable on the unpaid principal amount
thereof at the rate per annum indicated on the face of such Secured Note on
each Regular Distribution Date. Such interest will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Secured Notes will be issued at
varying discounts from par and, during the period from the Closing Date to and
including the Full Accrual Date (March 31, 2000), will provide a return
consisting of accretion of discount such that the yield to and including the
Full Accrual Date of the Secured Notes will equal the semi-annual bond
equivalent rate corresponding to the interest rate applicable to the Pass
Through Certificates. From and after April 1, 2000, the Secured Notes will
accrue interest payable in cash on each Regular Distribution Date (commencing
July 2, 2000) at the rate per annum indicated on the cover of this Prospectus
Supplement.
 
  Each Secured Note will accrete original issue discount from the Closing Date
to and including the Full Accrual Date, and, as used in this Prospectus
Supplement, the principal amount of each such Secured Note refers to the
accreted value of such Secured Note during the period that such Secured Note
is accreting discount, and after the Full Accrual Date, the face amount
thereof, as such amount may be reduced from time to time by the payment of
principal installments thereunder. The principal of, accreted discount, and
interest on the Secured Notes will be payable as set forth on Appendix B
hereto.
 
  If any date scheduled for any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Secured Note is not a Business Day, such payment may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day without any additional interest.
(Indentures, Section 2.03(b))
 
PREPAYMENTS
 
 Mandatory Prepayments
 
  In the event that (i) an Event of Loss shall occur with respect to any
Vessel, (ii) the Construction Contract for a Vessel is terminated prior to
delivery under circumstances which would obligate the Builder to pay a refund
under such Construction Contract or (iii) a Vessel shall not have been
delivered by the Builder on or prior to the Final Delivery Date, then the
related Owner Trust shall redeem, on a Special Distribution Date, the
outstanding Secured Note issued under the related Indenture at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of
redemption, but without the payment of any Make-Whole Amount or other premium.
See "Description of the Charters--The Charters--Event of Loss." Each Owner
Trust is eligible to receive a refund of the related Vessel's purchase price
under the related Construction Contract and the Supervisory Agreement in the
event
 
                                     S-20

 
that such Vessel is rejected thereunder, such Construction Contract is
cancelled in accordance with certain agreed terms or the Builder defaults in
delivery or otherwise breaches such Construction Contract in a manner
justifying rescission thereof. (Indentures, Section 3.02; Construction
Contracts, Section 6(g))
 
  In the event that (i) the Charterer exercises its voluntary termination
right under the related Charter, (ii) the Construction Contract for a Vessel
is terminated prior to its delivery under circumstances which would not
obligate the Builder to pay a refund under such Construction Contract or (iii)
a special termination occurs as a result of the termination of the related
Head Lease under circumstances where the related Charter is terminated or the
related Vessel is sold pursuant to such Head Lease and the new purchaser of
such Vessel is not substituted as obligor of the Secured Note issued under the
related Indenture, then the related Owner Trust shall redeem, on a Special
Distribution Date, such Secured Note, at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the unpaid principal amount thereof, together with any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus, if such
redemption is made prior to the Premium Termination Date, a premium equal to
the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any, with respect to such Secured Note,
and otherwise without premium. See "Description of the Charters--Termination"
in this Prospectus Supplement. (Indentures, Section 3.03; Charters, Article
18) If, in the case of certain early terminations of a Charter, a proposed
sale of the related Vessel Interest on such Charter termination date is not
completed, the corresponding redemption will not occur and any notice of
redemption will be deemed revoked. (Indentures, Section 3.10)
 
 Voluntary Prepayment
 
  At any time each Owner Trust may, with the prior written consent of the
Charterer, redeem the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount thereof,
together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including,
the date of redemption, plus, if such redemption is made prior to the Premium
Termination Date, a premium equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, with
respect to such Secured Note, and otherwise without premium. (Indentures,
Section 3.05) If notice of such a redemption shall have been given in
connection with a refinancing of the Secured Note, such notice may be revoked
not later than three Business Days prior to the proposed redemption date.
(Indentures, Section 3.10)
 
  In addition, each Secured Note is subject to purchase or redemption in whole
by the related Owner Trust or Owner Participant on any Special Distribution
Date if (i) an Indenture Event of Default under the related Indenture
resulting from one or more related Charter Events of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing for less than 180 days, during which time such
Secured Note could but shall not have been accelerated, at a price equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest
thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus, if such purchase
or redemption occurs prior to the Premium Termination Date, a premium equal to
the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any, or (ii) (A) an Indenture Event of
Default under the related Indenture resulting from one or more related Charter
Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing for more than 180
days, during which time such Secured Note could but shall not have been
accelerated, (B) the related Indenture Trustee shall have given such Owner
Trust or Owner Participant notice of its intent to accelerate such Secured
Note or (C) such Secured Note shall have been accelerated, at a price equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest
thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption, but without any Make-
Whole Amount or other premium. (Indentures, Section 3.06)
 
  The "Make-Whole Amount," if any, with respect to any Secured Note to be
redeemed shall be determined as of the fourth Business Day prior to the
applicable Redemption Date, and shall equal the excess, if any, of (a) the sum
of the present values of all remaining scheduled payments of principal and
interest from the applicable Redemption Date to the maturity of such Secured
Note, discounted semi-annually on each January 2 and July 2 at a rate equal to
the Treasury Rate (as
 
                                     S-21

 
defined below) plus 10 basis points, based on a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months, over (b) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Secured Note,
plus accrued but unpaid interest on such Secured Note (but not any accrued
interest in default) to such Redemption Date. The Make-Whole Amount, if any,
payable with respect to any Secured Note will be determined by an independent
investment banking institution of national standing (the "Investment Banker")
selected by the Charterer.
 
  The "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to each Secured Note to be redeemed
or purchased, a per annum rate (expressed as a semi-annual equivalent and as a
decimal and, in the case of U.S. Treasury bills, converted to a bond
equivalent yield) determined to be the per annum rate equal to the semi-annual
yield to maturity of U.S. Treasury securities maturing on the Average Life
Date (as defined below) of such Secured Note, as determined by interpolation
between the most recent weekly average yields to maturity for two series of
U.S. Treasury securities (A) one maturing as close as possible to, but earlier
than, the Average Life Date of such Secured Note and (B) the other maturing as
close as possible to, but later than, the Average Life Date of such Secured
Note, in each case as published in the most recent H.15(519) (or, if a weekly
average yield to maturity for United States Treasury securities maturing on
the Average Life Date of such Secured Note is reported in the most recent
H.15(519), as published in H.15(519)). H.15(519) means "Statistical Release
H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates," or any successor publication, published
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The most recent
H.15(519) means the latest H.15(519) which is published prior to the close of
business on the fourth Business Day prior to the Redemption Date.
 
  The "Average Life Date" for any Secured Note to be redeemed shall be the
date which follows the Redemption Date by a period equal to the Remaining
Weighted Average Life at the Redemption Date of such Secured Note. The
"Remaining Weighted Average Life" of such Secured Note at the Redemption Date
of such Secured Note is the number of days determined by dividing (A) the sum
of the products obtained by multiplying (1) the amount of each remaining
principal payment on such Secured Note by (2) the number of days from and
including the Redemption Date to but excluding the scheduled payment date of
such principal payment by (B) the then unpaid principal amount of such Secured
Note.
 
SECURITY
 
  The Secured Note issued under each Indenture is secured by, among other
things, (i) an assignment to the related Indenture Trustee of the related
Owner Trust's rights under the related Charter, including the right to receive
all payments under such Charter (other than Excepted Payments), (ii) an
assignment to the related Indenture Trustee of such Owner Trust's rights under
the related Parent Guaranty (other than rights in respect of Excepted
Payments) and (iii) an assignment to the related Indenture Trustee of such
Owner Trust's rights under the related Head Lease and certain other U.K.
Financing Documents. Because the Owner Trust will not hold title to the
related Vessel, it will not grant to the Indenture Trustee a mortgage on the
Vessel. (Indentures, Granting Clause) The U.K. Lessor has agreed that, upon
delivery of each Vessel, it will grant to the related Owner Trust a mortgage
on such Vessel securing, among other things, its obligation to pay to the
Owner Trust, by way of a rebate of rental payments or sales agency
commissions, a portion of any net proceeds realized by it upon any future sale
of such Vessel.
 
  So long as no Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
under an Indenture, the related Owner Trust will be entitled to exercise all
of its rights under the related Charter and under the other related Operative
Documents and the related Head Lease, subject to certain specific exceptions
(including with respect to amendments, waivers, modifications and consents
under specified provisions of certain of the Operative Documents). Each Owner
Trust's rights, however, do not include the right to receive payments of
Assigned Hire, which payments will be made directly to the related Indenture
Trustee. The assignment by each Owner Trust to the related Indenture Trustee
 
                                     S-22

 
of its rights under the related Charter and the other related Operative
Documents also excludes certain rights of such Owner Trust thereunder,
including rights relating to indemnification by the Charterer for certain
matters and insurance proceeds payable to such Owner Trust under liability
insurance maintained by the Charterer under the related Charter. (Indentures,
Granting Clause, Sections 6.08 and 9.02) For a description of certain other
rights of each Owner Trust, as owner under the related Charter, see
"Description of the Charters--The Charters--Charter Events of Default."
 
  Funds, if any, held from time to time by the related Indenture Trustee
pursuant to any related Operative Document will be invested and reinvested in
Permitted Investments by such Indenture Trustee at the direction of the
Charterer acting as agent of the related Owner Trust. The Charterer, on behalf
and as agent of each Owner Trust, is required to pay on demand to the
applicable Indenture Trustee the amount of any loss resulting from any such
investment. So long as no Charter Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under the related Charter, the Charterer is entitled to receive any
profits made from such investments. (Charters, Article 29(h); Indentures,
Section 7.04)
 
ADDITIONAL NOTES
 
  Additional Secured Notes ("Additional Notes") may be issued under and
secured by each Indenture, at any time and from time to time, to finance the
cost of certain modifications, alterations, additions and improvements to the
related Vessel ("Modifications") or certain additional costs of construction
("Alterations"); provided that certain conditions set forth in such Indenture
are satisfied, including, among other things, that (i) after giving effect to
the issuance of any such Additional Note the aggregate principal amount of the
related Secured Note and such Additional Note issued for the purpose of
financing the initial cost of the related Owner Trust's interest in such
Vessel shall not exceed 80% of such cost, (ii) after giving effect to the
issuance of any such Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of the
related Secured Note, any Additional Note issued under such Indenture to
finance the initial cost of the related Owner Trust's interest in such Vessel
and any other Additional Notes issued under such Indenture to finance any
Alterations or Modifications after the issuance of such Additional Notes will
not exceed 85% of the Fair Market Sales Value of such Vessel (taking into
account the value of such Modifications or Alterations), (iii) the aggregate
principal amount of any such Additional Notes issued in connection with such
Modifications or Alterations will not exceed 100% of the cost of such
Modifications or Alterations, as the case may be, (iv) the date of maturity of
the Additional Notes will not extend beyond the end of the applicable Charter
Period, and (v) no Charter Event of Default under the related Charter or
Indenture Event of Default under the related Indenture will have occurred and
be continuing on the date of issuance of the Additional Notes. Any such
Additional Notes may be issued to persons or entities (including, without
limitation, Mobil affiliates) other than the Pass Through Trustee.
(Indentures, Section 2.08)
 
  The terms, conditions and designations of any such Additional Notes will be
set forth in a supplement to the related Indenture. (Indentures, Section 2.08)
In addition, Assigned Hire and other amounts payable by the Charterer under
the related Charter will be adjusted to the extent necessary to provide
Assigned Hire sufficient to provide for the payment, when due, of all
scheduled payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
related Secured Notes, including any related Additional Notes. (Indentures,
Section 2.08) All Secured Notes issued and outstanding under an Indenture,
including any related Additional Notes, will be equally and ratably secured
thereunder, without preference, priority or distinction. (Indentures, Section
2.10)
 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 
  The Secured Note issued under each Indenture is not a direct obligation of,
or guaranteed by, the Charterer, Owner Trust, Owner Participant, Managing
Trustee or Delaware Trustee. None of the
 
                                     S-23

 
Owner Trust, Managing Trustee, Delaware Trustee, Owner Participant, Indenture
Trustee or U.K. Lessor with respect to any Vessel, or any affiliates thereof,
shall be personally liable to the holder of a related Secured Note or, in the
case of such U.K. Lessor, Owner Trust, Managing Trustee, Delaware Trustee and
Owner Participant, to the related Indenture Trustee for any amounts payable
under such Secured Note or, except as provided in the related Operative
Documents, for any liability under the related Indenture. Payments of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on each Secured Note (other than
payments made in connection with an optional redemption or purchase by the
related Owner Trust or Owner Participant) will be made only from the related
Indenture Estate or the income and proceeds received by the related Indenture
Trustee therefrom (including payments made by the Charterer under the related
Charter and payments, if any, made by Mobil under the related Parent
Guaranty). (Indentures, Section 2.02)
 
  Except as otherwise provided in each Indenture, none of the related
Indenture Trustee, Managing Trustee or Delaware Trustee, in its individual
capacity, shall be answerable or accountable under such Indenture or under the
related Secured Notes under any circumstances except, with respect to such
Indenture Trustee, Managing Trustee or Delaware Trustee, for (a) its own
willful misconduct or gross negligence, (b) failure to exercise reasonable
care in safeguarding securities held by it under such Indenture, (c) in case
of any inaccuracy of representation or warranty made by such Indenture
Trustee, Managing Trustee or Delaware Trustee under the related Operative
Documents, (d) any tax based on or measured by any fees, commissions or
compensation received by it for acting as trustee, (e) subject to certain
exceptions, failure to use reasonable care in disbursing funds in accordance
with such Indenture and (f) failure to remove certain liens in accordance with
the related Participation Agreement. (Indentures, Sections 7.01 and 7.03;
Participation Agreements, Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11) No Owner Participant will
have any duty or responsibility under the related Indenture or the Secured
Note issued thereunder to the related Indenture Trustee or to any holder of
such Secured Note. (Indentures, Section 2.02)
 
MERGER, CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS
 
  The Charterer will be prohibited from consolidating with or merging into any
other corporation or transferring substantially all of its assets to another
corporation unless the Charterer is the continuing corporation or, among other
things, (a) the successor corporation shall be a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the United States or any State or the District of
Columbia, (b) the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into
which the Charterer is merged or the corporation which acquires by conveyance,
transfer or charter all or substantially all of the assets of the Charterer as
an entirety shall expressly assume all obligations of the Charterer under each
of the Operative Documents and (c) after giving effect to such transaction,
the related Parent Guaranty remains in full force and effect and constitutes a
full and unconditional guaranty by Mobil of the successor corporation's
obligations under the related Charter and each of the Operative Documents to
which it is a party. (Participation Agreements, Section 12.3)
 
  Pursuant to each Parent Guaranty, Mobil will be prohibited from
consolidating with or merging into any other corporation, dissolving or
transferring all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation,
unless Mobil is the continuing corporation or such successor or transferee
expressly and unconditionally assumes the punctual performance and observance
of all covenants, conditions and obligations of Mobil under such Parent
Guaranty.
 
INDENTURE EVENTS OF DEFAULT, CURE, NOTICE AND WAIVER
 
  Events of Default under each Indenture include: (a) a related Charter Event
of Default (other than nonpayment of any Excess Hire or Excepted Payments)
that shall have occurred and be continuing, see "Description of Charters--
Charter Events of Default," (b) to the extent not arising from clause (a)
above, any payment of principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, or interest on
the related Secured
 
                                     S-24

 
Note shall not have been made when due and such default shall have continued
unremedied for ten Business Days after the same shall have become due and
payable, (c) failure by the applicable Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner
Participant to perform or observe in any material respect any covenant or
agreement contained in such Indenture or any other related Operative Document
which failure shall have continued for a period of 30 days after receipt of
notice by such Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner Participant from the
applicable Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee specifying such
failure and requiring it to be remedied (or if such failure is remediable and
the related Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner Participant is diligently
attempting to remedy such failure, such failure shall continue for a period of
180 days after receipt of notice thereof), (d) any representation or warranty
made by the applicable Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner Participant in
the related Participation Agreement being inaccurate in any material respect
as of the date made unless such inaccurate representation or warranty shall
not be material to the recipient thereof at the time the notice referred to
below is received by such Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner Participant
or any material adverse effect is cured or corrected within 30 days after
receipt of written notice to the related Owner Trust, Managing Trustee or
Owner Participant from the applicable Indenture Trustee; provided that, if
such material adverse effect is capable of being remedied and such Owner
Trust, Managing Trustee or Owner Participant is diligently attempting to
remedy such effect, such person shall have 90 days after receipt of written
notice thereof to remedy such material adverse effect, or (e) the occurrence
of certain events of bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of the related
Owner Participant or Owner Trust. (Indentures, Section 5.02)
 
  If a Charterer fails to make any Base Hire payment under the related Charter
within ten Business Days after the same has become due, the related Indenture
Trustee may not exercise remedies under such Charter or declare the related
Secured Note to be due and payable or exercise any other remedies under the
related Indenture until eleven days after the tenth Business Day of such
failure. If the related Owner Trust furnishes to the related Indenture Trustee
the amount of such Base Hire payment, together with interest thereon on
account of the delayed payment thereof, within such eleven day period, such
Indenture Trustee and holders of the related outstanding Secured Note may not
exercise any remedies otherwise available under such Indenture or such Charter
as the result of such failure. Each Owner Trust's rights to cure an Indenture
Event of Default resulting from the failure of a Charterer to pay Base Hire
under the related Charter will be limited to the right to cure an aggregate of
six defaults, or three consecutive defaults, under such Charter and may only
be exercised as long as no other Indenture Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing under the related Indenture. Each Owner Trust or Owner
Participant may also cure any other default by the Charterer in the
performance of its obligations under the related Charter and the other related
Operative Documents and any other Charter Event of Default if (but only if)
the performance or observance of such obligations or the cure of such Charter
Event of Default can be effected by the payment of money alone. Such cure
rights may be exercised as long as no other Indenture Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the related Indenture at any time prior to
the day which is the later of (x) the eleventh day subsequent to the date
notice of such default or Charter Event of Default is delivered by the related
Indenture Trustee to such Owner Trust or Owner Participant and (y) the
eleventh day subsequent to the expiration of the grace period, if any. During
such eleven day period, the applicable Indenture Trustee may not exercise
remedies under the related Charter or declare the related Secured Note to be
payable or otherwise exercise remedies under the related Indenture.
(Indentures, Section 5.03(a))
 
  To the extent of any payment made by the related Owner Participant or Owner
Trust described in the preceding paragraph, such Owner Participant or Owner
Trust shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the Secured Note
issued under the related Indenture to receive from the related Indenture
Trustee the payment of Assigned Hire or other amount for which such payment
was made by such Owner Participant or Owner Trust, as the case may be, and
such Owner Participant or Owner Trust, as the case may be, shall be entitled
to receive payment from such Indenture Trustee upon
 
                                     S-25

 
receipt thereof by the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that no such
amount shall be paid over to such Owner Participant or Owner Trustee, as the
case may be, unless all principal and interest on the related Secured Note
then due and payable and any other amounts then due and payable under such
Secured Note and the related Indenture shall have been paid in full and no
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon exercising any
such cure rights, neither such Owner Participant nor such Owner Trust shall
obtain any lien on the applicable Indenture Estate or Trust Estate on account
of such payment, nor shall any claim of such Owner Trust or Owner Participant
against the Charterer for the repayment thereof impair the prior right and
security interest of the related Indenture Trustee in and to the applicable
Indenture Estate.
 
  Pursuant to each Indenture, during the occurrence and continuance of an
Indenture Event of Default all payments under the related Charter (other than
Excepted Payments) or any other related Operative Documents will upon notice
to the Charterer become immediately payable by the Charterer to the related
Indenture Trustee, and such Indenture Trustee shall withhold any amounts
otherwise payable to the related Owner Trust until the earliest to occur of
(i) the first Business Day following the date that is 180 days after such
Indenture Trustee received such amount and (ii) the date that such Indenture
Event of Default is no longer continuing (in each of which cases described in
clauses (i) and (ii) such amounts shall be distributed to such Owner Trust,
unless, prior thereto, the related Secured Note shall have been accelerated or
such Indenture Trustee shall have given notice to the Owner Trust of its
intention to accelerate the related Secured Note or the Indenture Trustee
shall have served notice of its intent to declare the related Charter to be in
default (in which case such amounts shall be applied as provided in the
related Indenture)). (Indentures, Section 4.01(c))
 
  The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes
issued under each Indenture, by written directive to the applicable Indenture
Trustee, may direct such Indenture Trustee to waive any past default under
such Indenture, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on, or other amounts due under any such Secured Notes or a
default in respect of any covenant or provision of such Indenture that cannot
be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of such Secured
Notes and, provided, that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Indenture Event of Default. (Indentures, Section 5.08)
 
REMEDIES
 
  If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the related
Indenture Trustee may, and when instructed by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes outstanding under the related
Indenture shall, exercise all of the rights and powers provided under the
related Indenture or available under applicable law; provided, however, such
Indenture Trustee must give the related Owner Trust at least ten Business
Days' (or five Business Days in the case of acceleration of the related
Secured Note other than an automatic acceleration of the related Secured Note)
prior written notice of its intention to exercise remedies under such
Indenture. Subject to the provisions of the related Indenture, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Indenture Event of Default, the
related Indenture Trustee may exercise all rights and remedies of the related
Owner Trust to the exclusion of such Owner Trust under the related Charter
(other than those rights and remedies relating to Excepted Payments),
including, without limitation, the right to take possession of all or any part
of the related Indenture Estate and exclude such Owner Trust and all persons
(including the Charterer but excluding the related U.K. Lessor to the extent
of such U.K. Lessor's rights upon the termination of the related Head Lease)
claiming under such Owner Trust. Upon at least 25 days' prior written notice
to the related Owner Participant and the related Owner Trust, the related
Indenture Trustee may invoke and exercise the power of sale and sell any or
all of the related Indenture Estate in the manner required by law at public
auction, or in any other manner which shall be in accordance with applicable
law, or, such Indenture Estate may be foreclosed, and such Indenture Trustee
may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction; provided that (i)
such Indenture Trustee
 
                                     S-26

 
shall not sell, assign, transfer or deliver any of such Indenture Estate or
take possession of such Indenture Estate unless the related Secured Note has
been accelerated and (ii) no exercise of any remedies by such Indenture
Trustee may affect the rights of the Charterer under the related Charter
unless a Charter Event of Default thereunder has occurred and is continuing
and such Charter has been declared to be in default in accordance therewith.
In addition, each Indenture Trustee's right to exercise foreclosure remedies
under the related Indenture is subject in certain circumstances to its having
proceeded to exercise one or more material remedies under the related Charter
seeking to terminate such Charter, unless at the time, such Indenture Trustee
is stayed or otherwise prevented from doing so by operation of law, in which
case such Indenture Trustee has agreed to refrain from exercising remedies
under such Indenture for a period of up to 180 days from the date of the
commencement of such prohibition. If the Charterer were a debtor in a
proceeding under Title 11, United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), during
a Charter Event of Default under the related Charter, the condition described
in the immediately preceding sentence could not be met by the related
Indenture Trustee during the period when certain actions against such bankrupt
Charterer, including actions to dispossess the Charterer, would be barred by
the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. See "Description of the
Charters--Charter Events of Default." (Indentures, Section 5.04)
 
  If an Indenture Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Charter
Events of Default or an Indenture Event of Default relating to the bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency of the related Owner Participant or Owner Trust
or the Charterer or Guarantor) occurs and is continuing, then the related
Indenture Trustee may, and when instructed by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes outstanding under the Indenture
shall, at any time, by five days' written notice to the related Owner Trust,
declare the unpaid principal of the related Secured Note then outstanding,
together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts due
thereunder, immediately due and payable. In the case of certain bankruptcy-
related Indenture Events of Default under each Indenture, the related Secured
Note shall automatically become due and payable. The holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Secured Note outstanding under each
Indenture may rescind and annul any such acceleration at any time before the
entry of any judgment or decree for the payment of the money so due, provided
all overdue installments of principal of and interest on such Secured Note, if
any, and all other amounts payable under such Secured Note (except the
principal of such Secured Note which by such acceleration shall have become
payable) have been duly paid and every other Indenture Event of Default under
such Indenture has been cured. (Indentures, Section 5.04)
 
  Each Indenture provides that if the related Indenture Trustee has actual
knowledge of any Indenture Event of Default under such Indenture (or an event
which, after the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become
an Indenture Event of Default), any failure on the part of the Charterer under
each Charter to make any payment of Assigned Hire when due or any Event of
Loss, such Indenture Trustee will give prompt notice of such event to the
related Owner Trust, Owner Participant and Charterer and, within 90 days after
obtaining such actual knowledge, mail to the holders of the related Secured
Note notice of any such Indenture Event of Default unless, in each case, such
Indenture Event of Default has been remedied before the giving of such notice.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Note
then outstanding under each Indenture may instruct the related Indenture
Trustee to give such notice, consent or direction or exercise such right,
remedy or power under the related Indenture or Charter or in respect of the
related Indenture Estate or take such other action as shall be specified in
such instruction, provided that such action is authorized to be taken under
the related Indenture. If the related Indenture Trustee has not received such
instruction from the holders of such Secured Note within 20 days after mailing
of the notice described in the first sentence of this paragraph, such
Indenture Trustee may take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
but will be under no duty to take or refrain from taking any action, with
respect to such Indenture Event of Default, Event of Loss or fact as it
determines to be
 
                                     S-27

 
advisable and in the best interest of the holders of such Secured Note. In any
such event, however, each Indenture provides that the related Indenture
Trustee will not be required to take any action or refrain from taking any
action instructed to be taken or refrained from being taken unless such
Indenture Trustee has been indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction against
any liability in the performance of any of its duties under such Indenture.
(Indentures, Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.04)
 
  If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing under any
Indenture and the applicable Indenture Trustee (as security assignee) has
declared the related Charter to be in default or the related Secured Note has
been accelerated, any sums held or received by such Indenture Trustee will be
applied, first, to reimburse such Indenture Trustee for any tax, expense or
other loss incurred by it and to pay any other amounts then due such Indenture
Trustee, second, to reimburse the holders of the related Secured Note for any
amounts paid to indemnify such Indenture Trustee as provided in the related
Indenture and, third, to pay in full the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
such Secured Note then outstanding and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon
to the date of distribution. (Indentures, Section 4.03)
 
BANKRUPTCY OF OWNER TRUST OR OWNER PARTICIPANT
 
  Although each Owner Trust has been structured as a special-purpose entity
the activities of which are expressly limited to the lease financing
transaction contemplated by the Operative Documents related thereto, it is
possible that such Owner Trust could become the subject of a proceeding under
the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, receipt of payments by the related
Indenture Trustee under the related Charter, Parent Guaranty and Secured Note
may be interrupted, and the exercise of remedies by such Indenture Trustee,
including foreclosure of the related Indenture, would be stayed during the
pendency of bankruptcy proceedings. Subject to certain procedural and
substantive safeguards provided by the Bankruptcy Code (such as the
requirement that the debtor-in-possession or trustee provide adequate
protection of the interests of the holders of the related Secured Note), a
bankruptcy court could permit the use or disposition of Bareboat Hire,
including Assigned Hire, and other payments under the related Charter and the
related Indenture Estate for purposes other than making payments on such
Secured Note, or could modify the interest rate, maturity and payment terms of
such Secured Note.
 
  In the event of the bankruptcy of the related Owner Participant, it is
possible that, notwithstanding that the related Vessel is not owned by the
Owner Participant and title is not held by the related Owner Trust, such
Vessel, the related Charter, Parent Guaranty and Secured Note could become
part of the bankruptcy proceeding. In such event, payments under the related
Charter, Parent Guaranty or Secured Note could be interrupted and the ability
of the related Indenture Trustee to exercise its remedies under the related
Indenture might be restricted, although such Indenture Trustee would retain
its status as a secured creditor in respect of such Charter, Parent Guaranty
and Vessel.
 
MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS
 
  Without the consent of holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Secured Notes outstanding under any Indenture, the provisions of such
Indenture and the related Charter, Participation Agreement, Trust Agreement,
Head Lease, Construction Contract and any other related Operative Documents
may not be amended or modified, except to the extent indicated below.
 
  Certain provisions of each Indenture, the related Charter, Participation
Agreement, Trust Agreement, Head Lease and any other related Operative
Document may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties thereto
without the consent of holders of the Secured Notes outstanding under such
Indenture so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing thereunder. In the case of each Charter, such provisions include,
among others, provisions relating to (i) payments under the Charter and other
payments, except to the extent indicated in clause (f) of the
 
                                     S-28

 
following paragraph, (ii) the maintenance of the related Vessel, modifications
to such Vessel and the return to the related Owner Trust of such Vessel at the
end of the applicable Charter Period and (iii) the renewal of such Charter. In
addition, prior to an Indenture Event of Default, the Construction Contract
with respect to a Vessel may be amended or modified without the consent of any
holder of the related Secured Notes; provided that such amendment or
modification does not decrease (except to a de minimis extent) the Fair Market
Sales Value of such Vessel or decrease the useful life or utility of such
Vessel. (Indentures, Section 9.02)
 
  Without the consent of each holder of a Secured Note outstanding under the
related Indenture, no amendment or modification of such Indenture or any
related Operative Document may (a) change the stated maturity or reduce the
principal amount of, or premium, if any, or interest payable on any Secured
Note issued under such Indenture or impair the right to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment or change mandatory or optional prepayment
provisions or change the date or place on which, or the coin or currency in
which, any principal or premium, if any, or interest is due and payable, (b)
create any lien with respect to the property subject to the Lien of such
Indenture, except as permitted in such Indenture, or deprive any holder of a
Secured Note issued thereunder of the benefit of the Lien of such Indenture,
(c) change the percentage in principal amount of any outstanding Secured Notes
issued under such Indenture necessary to modify or amend any provision of such
Indenture or any other related Operative Document or to waive compliance
therewith, (d) modify the definitions of "Indenture Default," "Indenture Event
of Default," "Majority in Interest of Holders of Notes," "Charter Default," or
"Charter Event of Default," (e) modify the order of priority of payments under
such Indenture, (f) reduce the amount or change the time of any payment of
Assigned Hire under the related Charter, (g) modify the requirements for
supplementing or amending such Indenture, (h) amend the related Charter or the
related Parent Guaranty releasing the Charterer or Mobil from its respective
payment obligations thereunder or changing the absolute and unconditional
character of such obligations or (i) modify the indemnity provisions of any
related Operative Documents in any manner materially adverse to the interests
of the holders of the related Secured Notes. (Indentures, Section 9.02(a))
 
  Without the consent of the holders of the Secured Notes issued under an
Indenture, and at any time from time to time, the related Indenture Trustee
and the related Owner Trust may enter into one or more supplements or
amendments to such Indenture, among other things, (i) to subject additional
property to the lien of such Indenture, (ii) to correct or amplify the
description of any property subject to the lien of such Indenture, (iii) to
add to the covenants of such Owner Trust and to surrender any right or power
conferred upon such Owner Trust, the related Owner Participant or the
Charterer, (iv) to cure any ambiguity or to correct any mistake in the Secured
Notes which may be inconsistent with other provisions of such Indenture, (v)
to provide for the assumption by the Charterer of the obligations of such
Owner Trust under the Indenture as described under "Description of the Secured
Note--Substitution of Obligor Under Certain Circumstances" in this Prospectus
Supplement, (vi) to evidence the succession of a new Owner Trust or Indenture
Trustee, (vii) to add to the rights of the holders of such Secured Notes or
(viii) to provide for the establishment and issuance of Additional Notes under
such Indenture as described under "Description of the Secured Note--Additional
Notes" in this Prospectus Supplement, or refunding such Secured Notes in
connection with a refinancing of such Secured Notes. (Indenture, Section 9.01)
 
SUBSTITUTION OF OBLIGOR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
 
  If, in connection with the termination of a Head Lease, the related Vessel
is sold to another owner trust (a "Substitute Obligor"), then such Substitute
Obligor may assume all of the rights and obligations of the related Owner
Trust under the related Indenture and other related Operative Documents. Such
assumption shall be subject to certain terms and conditions, including, among
other things, that (i) the Substitute Obligor shall execute and deliver to the
applicable Indenture
 
                                     S-29

 
Trustee a supplement to such Indenture whereby, among other things, such
Substitute Obligor shall assume all of the obligations of such Owner Trust
with respect to the related Secured Note and will agree that it is purchasing
the related Vessel subject to the security interest (or a security interest in
the same or substantially identical terms) on the related Vessel in favor of
the related Indenture Trustee; (ii) such Substitute Obligor shall cause to be
delivered to such Indenture Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that,
among other things, all filings and recordings and other actions necessary or
appropriate to protect the interests of such Indenture Trustee have been
accomplished; (iii) the Substitute Obligor shall execute and deliver to the
applicable Indenture Trustee a ship mortgage on the Vessel in favor of
Indenture Trustee which ship mortgage shall become part of the Indenture
Estate; and (iv) Mobil shall have confirmed that the related Parent Guaranty
remains in full force and effect. Upon such assumption, the related Owner
Trust will be released from all obligations with respect to such Secured Note.
The Substitute Obligor may not effect such assumption (a) if any event which
constitutes an Indenture Event of Default under the related Indenture shall be
continuing after giving effect to such assumption or (b) unless both of the
Rating Agencies shall have delivered to the related Indenture Trustee
confirmation that such assumption will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal
of such Rating Agency's then current credit rating of the Pass Through
Certificates. (Indentures, Section 3.04)
 
                                     S-30

 
                          DESCRIPTION OF THE CHARTERS
 
THE CHARTERS
 
 Term and Hire
 
  Each Owner Trust will bareboat charter the relevant Vessel to the Charterer
pursuant to the related Charter. Each Charter commences on the Closing Date
and runs through January 2, 2018, unless such Charter is earlier terminated or
extended as described herein. (Charters, Article 2) The Charterer has the sole
responsibility and obligation to make all payments due under each Charter,
including any and all payments of Assigned Hire. (Charters, Article 3) The
Charterer's obligation to make payments under each Charter is guaranteed by
Mobil under the related Parent Guaranty. (Parent Guaranties, Article 2)
 
  Each Owner Trust's right to receive payments under the related Charter and
other amounts payable under the related Operative Documents (other than
Excepted Payments) has been assigned under the related Indenture to the
related Indenture Trustee. Pursuant to the terms of each Indenture, until an
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Charterer will
pay only Assigned Hire under the related Charter directly to the related
Indenture Trustee. Such payments will be used to make scheduled payments of
principal and accrued and unpaid interest then due on the related Secured Note
issued under such Indenture, which will furnish the funds to be distributed to
the Pass Through Trustee and thereafter to the Certificateholders. The
Charterer will pay all other amounts payable under each Charter directly to
the related Owner Trust for distribution to the related Owner Participant and
any such amounts will not be available for distribution to the
Certificateholders except in certain cases upon the occurrence of an Indenture
Event of Default under the related Indenture. If an Indenture Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing with respect to an Indenture, upon written
notice from the related Indenture Trustee to the Charterer, all payments under
the related Charter and the other Operative Documents (other than Excepted
Payments) will be payable by the Charterer directly to such Indenture Trustee
and then distributed in accordance with the terms of such Indenture. The
Charterer's obligation to make payments of Assigned Hire under each Charter is
an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional obligation of the Charterer and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation: any
claim, setoff, deduction, defense or counterclaim; any defect in the
condition, design, quality or fitness for use of the related Vessel or any
part thereof; the failure of the Builder to construct or deliver such Vessel;
any damage to or destruction of or any requisition or taking of such Vessel;
any interruption or interference with any use, operation or possession of such
Vessel, including, without limitation, as a result of a termination of or
default under the related Head Lease. (Charters, Article 9) The Charterer's
obligations under each Charter are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed
by Mobil under the related Parent Guaranty. (Parent Guaranties, Article 2)
 
  Payments of Assigned Hire due to an Owner Trust under the related Charter
will be payable directly to the related Indenture Trustee on January 2 and
July 2 in each year (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next
succeeding Business Day without interest) commencing July 2, 2000. (Charters,
Article 3(e)) Assigned Hire payable under each Charter will be sufficient to
pay in full all scheduled payments of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on, the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. In certain
cases, payments under each Charter may be adjusted; however, Assigned Hire
payments may never be less than the scheduled payments of principal of and
interest on the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. (Charters,
Article 3)
 
  The balance of any payments of Assigned Hire under each Charter, after
payment of the scheduled principal of premium, if any, and interest payments
on the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture, will be paid by the
related Indenture Trustee to the related Owner Trust or as such Owner Trust
may direct. (Indenture, Section 4.01)
 
                                     S-31

 
 Net Charter; Head Lease Obligations; Use and Maintenance
 
  The obligations of the Charterer under each Charter are those of a charterer
under a "net charter." (Charters, Article 9) To the extent there are any
obligations imposed on the related Owner Trust under the related Head Lease,
the Charterer shall take such action as may be required to permit such Owner
Trust to perform, or shall itself perform, such obligations to the extent
necessary to keep such Head Lease in full force and effect. During the Charter
Period with respect to each Charter, the Charterer must maintain and preserve
each Vessel in such condition as will entitle it to maintain the same
classification and rating of the American Bureau of Shipping as when delivered
to it under each related Charter (except from changes in class resulting
solely from the age of such Vessel). At all times during the applicable
Charter Period, the Charterer shall operate and maintain (or cause any
Permitted Subcharterer to operate and maintain) the related Vessel in
accordance with the established maintenance and repair programs in effect for
MOSAT for similar vessels so as to keep such Vessel (a) in good working order
and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted and (b) in compliance, in all
material respects, with applicable Government Rules and Government Actions and
requirements of the American Bureau of Shipping ("ABS") (except to the extent
(i) the Charterer is permitted to contest such Government Rules and Government
Actions or ABS requirements, (ii) an exemption from compliance therewith is
obtained, (iii) good faith efforts and appropriate steps to comply are being
taken and such compliance is effected prior to the date such Vessel Interest
is returned to the related Owner Trust or (iv) noncompliance does not result
in any material adverse consequence to the Charterer, the related Owner Trust,
the Owner Participant or the U.K. Lessor; so long as, in the case of clauses
(i) and (iv), such contest or failure of compliance does not result in any
material risk of (x) the sale, forfeiture or loss of such Vessel or the
related Vessel Interest, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, (y) interference of
the payment of hire, including Assigned Hire, under the related Charter when
due or (z) the imposition of any criminal liability on the related Owner
Trust, Owner Participant, Indenture Trustee, U.K. Lessor, Trust Estate,
Indenture Estate or Vessel Interest) and (b) keep such Vessel in good working
order and condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted). (Charters, Article
11(a)) With respect to any Charter, unless a Charter Event of Default is
continuing under such Charter and such Charter has been declared to be in
default, the related Indenture Trustee has agreed not to take or cause any
action to be taken which would be contrary to the Charterer's rights under
such Charter. (Indentures, Section 5.09)
 
 Modifications and Alterations
 
  At all times during the applicable Charter Period, the Charterer shall make
(or cause to be made) all Modifications to the related Vessel as may be
required from time to time to comply in all material respects with applicable
Government Rules or Government Actions or ABS requirements or to maintain any
insurance coverage required under such Charter, unless the Charterer shall
have elected to terminate such Charter. The Charterer shall complete (or cause
to be completed) all such Modifications in a good and workmanlike manner, with
reasonable dispatch and (but only to the extent practicable) in a manner which
does not decrease (except to a de minimis extent) the Fair Market Sales Value
of such Vessel or decrease the remaining useful life or utility of such Vessel
or cause such Vessel to become "limited use property." The Charterer may make
(or allow to be made) other Modifications to the related Vessel, at its own
cost and expense and without the consent of the related Owner Trust or
Indenture Trustee; provided that such other Modifications (i) do not reduce
(except to a de minimis extent) the Fair Market Sales Value, remaining useful
life or utility of such Vessel and (ii) do not cause such Vessel to become
"limited use property." (Charters, Article 13)
 
 Subcharter and Assignment
 
  The Charterer may, without the consent of the related Owner Trust, the
related Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee or any other Person, at
any time and from time to time, assign the related Charter and its interests
and rights thereunder to any person, so long as, among other
 
                                     S-32

 
conditions, (i) after giving effect to such assignment, the related Parent
Guaranty remains in full force and effect and constitutes a full and
unconditional guaranty of the obligations of the assignee under such Charter
to the same extent as the guaranty of the Charterer's obligations under such
Charter prior to giving effect to any such assignment, (ii) certain material
related Charter Events of Default and bankruptcy Charter Defaults are not
continuing on the date any such assignment to any affiliate of the Charterer
is effected and no such Charter Event of Default or bankruptcy Charter Default
is continuing on the date such assignment to any other person is effected,
(iii) such assignment shall not result in the violation of any Government Rule
or the Head Lease, (iv) such assignee shall have validly assumed the
obligations of the Charterer under the Charter and each of the other related
Operative Documents to which the Charterer is a party and (v) such assignment
will not result in any adverse tax consequences to the holders of the Pass
Through Certificates.
 
  The Charterer may, without the consent of the related Owner Trust, the
Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, at any time and from time to
time, subcharter the related Vessel Interest to another Person; provided that,
among other conditions, (i) such subcharter is expressly subject and
subordinate to the related Charter (and such subcharter contains a provision
providing that any subcharter permitted thereunder shall be so subject and
subordinate) and in no event continues beyond the related Charter Period, (ii)
the Charterer remains primarily liable under the related Charter and under the
other related Operative Documents to which it is a party as though no such
subcharter was in existence, (iii) the related Parent Guaranty remains in full
force and effect, (iv) certain Charter Events of Default and bankruptcy
Charter Defaults under the related Charter are not continuing at the
commencement of such subcharter and (v) any such subcharter with a term in
excess of six months shall be approved by the related Owner Trust prior to its
execution. Any subcharterer under a subcharter permitted under any Charter may
sub-subcharter the related Vessel Interest to another person under a sub-
subcharter that otherwise complies with the provisions of such Charter
applicable to a subcharter thereunder. The Charterer intends to subcharter the
Vessel Interest to Mobil Shipping Company Limited ("MSCL"), a company formed
under the laws of England and Wales, pursuant to an Initial Subcharter.
(Charters, Article 20(c))
 
 Liens
 
  Each Vessel Interest will be maintained free of Liens other than (a) the
respective rights and interests of the Charterer, Owner Participant, Owner
Trust, Indenture Trustee and the holders of the Secured Notes issued under the
related Indenture, as provided in the related Operative Documents and the
interests of the Builder pursuant to the related Construction Contract, (b)
related Owner Trust's Liens, Owner Participant's Liens and Indenture Trustee's
Liens, (c) Liens for Taxes either not delinquent or being contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings, so long as such proceedings do not
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any part of the
related Vessel, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, or title thereto or any
interest therein or any material danger of the interference with any payments
of hire, including Assigned Hire, under the Charter, (d) materialmen's,
mechanics', workers', repairmen's, employees' or other like Liens, arising in
the ordinary course of business, or arising in the course of constructing,
repairing, equipping or installing, modifying or expanding the related Vessel
or any part thereof, for amounts either not more than 180 days past due or
being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings, so long as such
proceedings do not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss
of any part of the related Vessel, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, or title
thereto or any interest therein and any material danger of interference with
any payments of hire, including Assigned Hire, under the Charter, (e) Liens
arising out of judgments or awards against the Charterer or any subcharterer
with respect to which at the time an appeal or proceeding for review is being
prosecuted in good faith, so long as such judgment, award or appeal does not
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any part of the
related Vessel, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, or title thereto or any
interest therein or any material danger of interference with any payments of
hire, including Assigned Hire, under the Charter, (f) the
 
                                     S-33

 
rights and interests of the U.K. Lessor to the related Vessel, including its
rights as owner of the Vessel and as otherwise provided under the U.K.
Documents, (g) Liens for current crew's wages, for general average or salvage
(including contract salvage) or for wages of stevedores employed directly by
the Charterer, MSCL or the operator, agent or master of the related Vessel
which in each case (A) are unclaimed or covered by insurance or (B) are for
amounts either not more than 180 days past due or being contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings, so long as such proceedings do not
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any part of the
related Vessel, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, or title thereto or any
interest therein or any material danger of interference with any payments of
hire, including Assigned Hire, under the Charter and Liens which are for
amounts either not more than 180 days past due or being contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any part of the
related Vessel, Vessel Interest, Trust Estate or Indenture Estate, or title
thereto or any interest therein and any material danger of interference with
any payments of hire, including Assigned Hire, under the Charter, and (h)
assignments and subcharters permitted by the related Charter and the rights of
MSCL under the Initial Subcharter and the rights of any other subcharterer or
any sub-subcharterer under any other subcharter (or sub-subcharter) permitted
by the related Charter.
 
 Insurance
 
  At all times during the applicable Charter Period, the Charterer will
maintain protection and indemnity insurance (including pollution liability
insurance) with respect to each Vessel to the extent such insurance is
commercially available in such amounts, and with such deductible or self
insurance amounts and in such forms as are consistent with the practice of
affiliates of Mobil for other vessels similar to such Vessel owned by or
leased to such affiliate. If consistent with the requirements of the related
Charter, such insurance may be carried under blanket policies maintained by or
on behalf of the Charterer and may be carried by insurers that are affiliates
of Mobil.
 
  In addition, unless it would result in material incremental cost to the
Charterer or any permitted subcharterer, each insurance policy will name the
related Owner Trust and the Owner Participant and, at such times as it is the
mortgagee of a Vessel, the related Indenture Trustee as additional insureds
and will provide an endorsement that such insurance shall be primary without
right of contribution of any other insurance carried by or on behalf of such
additional insureds. (Charters, Article 16)
 
 Voluntary Termination
 
  Economic Termination. The Charterer has the right, upon 90 days' prior
written notice to the related Owner Trust, to terminate any Charter with
respect to the related Vessel Interest on any Termination Value Determination
Date (a "Termination Date") if the Charterer determines in good faith that the
continuation of such Charter is uneconomic by reason of the cost of compliance
with Governmental Rules or Governmental Actions or by reason of indemnity
payments required to be made to any person under such Charter or the related
Participation Agreement. If a Charterer elects so to terminate a related
Charter, the Charterer shall, as agent for the related Owner Trust, use
reasonable efforts to solicit bids for the cash purchase of the related Vessel
Interest on the Termination Date. On the Termination Date, the related Owner
Trust will be obligated to transfer its interest in the related Vessel
Interest to the highest bona fide cash bidder, unless the related Owner Trust
has duly elected to retain its interest in such Vessel Interest. If the
related Vessel Interest is sold, the related Owner Trust shall retain the
total net sales price thereof and the Charterer will be obligated to pay to
such Owner Trust an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Value of
such Vessel Interest over the net proceeds realized from the sale thereof. The
Charterer also will be obligated under each Charter to pay to the related
Owner Trust (or, in the case of certain amounts of
 
                                     S-34

 
Supplemental Hire, to the person entitled thereto) on the Termination Date all
accrued, due and unpaid Bareboat Hire and all Supplemental Hire then due and
owing (including the Make-Whole Amount, if any). If the related Owner Trust
elects to retain the Vessel Interest, the Charterer will be obligated to pay
all accrued, due and unpaid Bareboat Hire and all Supplemental Hire then due
and owing (including the Make-Whole Amount, if any) on such Vessel Interest,
and the related Owner Trust will be obligated to pay to the Indenture Trustee
an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest on, the Secured Notes issued under the related
Indenture. If an Owner Trust fails to make such payment, the Charterer's
termination election will be deemed to have been revoked. All funds to be paid
or deposited with an Owner Trust as described in this paragraph shall, so long
as the related Indenture shall not have been discharged, be deposited directly
with the related Indenture Trustee and shall be applied to redeem in full the
Secured Note issued under the related Indenture as provided in such Indenture.
Amounts in excess of amounts applied to redeem the Secured Note in accordance
with the related Indenture will be distributed by the related Indenture
Trustee in accordance with the terms of the related Indenture. The Lien of the
related Indenture will terminate with respect to the related Vessel Interest
after the Termination Value thereof has been paid in full and all other
amounts then due and payable have been paid and, if all amounts due the
related Owner Participant have also been paid, the related Charter shall also
terminate with respect to such Vessel Interest. The Charterer will be
entitled, subject to certain limitations, to revoke its termination election
not less than 30 days prior to the Termination Date. In the event that the
related Head Lease shall have terminated in circumstances where the related
U.K. Lessor is obliged to conclude the sale of the related Vessel Interest,
the Charterer shall have no obligation to solicit bids for the cash purchase
of the related Vessel Interest on the Termination Date as agent for the
related Owner Trust, and any proceeds from such sale to which such Owner Trust
is entitled shall be applied against the obligations of the Charterer under
the related Charter in respect of the payment of Termination Value.
 
  If no sale or retention of the applicable Vessel Interest shall have
occurred by the Termination Date, the related Charter will continue in full
force and effect.
 
 Special Termination
 
  If the Builder has not delivered a Vessel by the Final Delivery Date, or the
Construction Contract with respect to such Vessel shall have been terminated,
cancelled or rescinded for any reason prior to the Delivery Date or if, in
connection with the termination of a Head Lease, the related Charter is
terminated or the related Vessel is sold and the purchaser for any reason
shall not have become a Substitute Obligor in compliance with the provisions
of the related Indenture and the other Operative Documents, the Charterer will
be required to pay to the related Indenture Trustee the applicable Termination
Value of such Vessel. Such amount shall be applied to redeem in full the
Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. See "Description of Secured
Notes--Substitution of Obligor Under Certain Circumstances" and "--
Prepayments."
 
 Event of Loss
 
  In the event any Vessel suffers an Event of Loss, the Charterer will be
obligated to pay the Termination Value thereof. So long as the related
Indenture shall not have been discharged, the Charterer will deposit
Termination Value directly with the related Indenture Trustee and such amount
shall be applied to redeem in full the Secured Note issued under the related
Indenture. Amounts, if any, in excess of amounts applied to redeem such
Secured Note in accordance with the related Indenture will be distributed by
the related Indenture Trustee in accordance with the terms of the related
Indenture. The Lien of the related Indenture will terminate with respect to
such Vessel Interest after full payment of the Termination Value thereof and
all other amounts then due and payable have been paid and, if all amounts due
to the related Owner Participant have also been paid, the related Charter
shall also terminate with respect to such Vessel Interest.
 
                                     S-35

 
  An Event of Loss with respect to each Vessel is defined to include (a) the
loss, theft, destruction or disappearance of, or the occurrence of damage
(which, in the Charterer's reasonable, good faith opinion, renders repair or
replacement uneconomic) to, such Vessel (or substantially the entirety of such
Vessel); (b) the permanent condemnation, confiscation or seizure of, or
requisition of title to, such Vessel by any Governmental Authority; (c) the
requisition of use of such Vessel by any Governmental Authority for a period
which exceeds the remaining portion of the applicable Charter Period; or (d)
the receipt of insurance proceeds based upon an actual or constructive total
loss of such Vessel.
 
 Charter Events of Default
 
  Charter Events of Default with respect to each Charter include, among other
things: (a) the failure to make any payment of Assigned Hire and such failure
shall continue for ten Business Days after the date such payment was due, (b)
the failure to make payments of Supplemental Hire or any other payment under
the related Charter (other than Assigned Hire or any Excess Hire or Excepted
Payments (unless the related Owner Trust elects to make the failure to make
such payment of Excess Hire or Excepted Payment constitute a Charter Event of
Default)) or any other amount payable under any other related Operative
Document and such failure continues for a period of 30 days after notice of
such failure to the Charterer from the related Owner Trust or Indenture
Trustee, (c) failure by the Charterer to perform or observe in any material
respect any material covenant or agreement (not included in clause (a) or (b)
above) to be performed or observed by it under such Charter or any other
related Operative Document (other than any covenant or agreement to pay Excess
Hire or to make an Excepted Payment) and such failure shall continue for a
period of 30 days after receipt by the Charterer of written notice thereof
specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied from the related Owner
Trust or the related Indenture Trustee (or 365 days after such notice, if such
default is susceptible of cure and the Charterer is diligently attempting to
cure such default), (d) failure by Mobil to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement to be performed or observed by it under the related Parent Guaranty
in any material respect (other than any covenant or agreement in respect of
the Charterer's obligations under the related Operative Documents) and such
failure shall continue for a period of 30 days after receipt by Mobil of
written notice thereof from the related Owner Trust or Indenture Trustee (or
365 days after such notice, if such default is susceptible of cure and Mobil
is diligently attempting to cure such default), (e) any material
representation or warranty made by the Charterer or Mobil in certain sections
of the related Participation Agreement or in the related Parent Guaranty or in
certain certificates delivered pursuant to such Participation Agreement shall
have been materially false when made and any material adverse impact thereof
shall remain uncured or uncorrected for 30 days after written notice thereof
from the related Owner Trust or Indenture Trustee (or 365 days after such
notice, if such material adverse impact is susceptible of cure, so long as the
Charterer or Mobil, as applicable, is diligently attempting to cure such
misrepresentation) unless such inaccuracy shall not be material to the
recipient of the representation or warranty at the time such written notice
was received, (f) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency of the Charterer or Mobil, (g) the related Parent
Guaranty shall cease to be in full force and effect or to be the valid,
binding and enforceable agreement of Mobil or (h) the Charterer shall fail to
maintain the insurance policies required by such Charter and such failure
shall continue for a period of 30 days following receipt of notice thereof
from the related Owner Trust or Indenture Trustee. (Charters, Article 21)
 
  Upon the occurrence and continuance of a Charter Event of Default under any
Charter, the related Indenture Trustee, as assignee of the related Owner
Trust, may declare such Charter to be in default by written notice to the
Charterer. Except as provided below, the related Indenture Trustee may at any
time thereafter exercise one or more of the remedies set forth in the related
Charter, including the right to terminate such Charter (which termination
would result in an automatic termination of the related Head Lease), to
repossess the related Vessel Interest, to sell such Vessel
 
                                     S-36

 
Interest or any part thereof free and clear of the Charterer's rights, and,
under certain circumstances, retain the proceeds, and, so long as such Vessel
Interest has not been sold, to require the Charterer to pay as liquidated
damages unpaid Bareboat Hire and accrued interest plus any one of the
following: (a) an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Value over the
Fair Market Sales Value of such Vessel Interest, as of the payment date
specified by such Owner Trust by written notice to the Charterer (or the last
day of the applicable Charter Period, if earlier) or (b) an amount equal to
Termination Value as of such date in which event such Vessel Interest shall be
transferred to the Charterer. If any Vessel Interest has been sold, the
related Owner Trust may require the Charterer to pay as liquidated damages an
amount equal to the sum of (x) all accrued and unpaid Bareboat Hire and
Supplemental Hire plus (y) the amount of any deficiency between Termination
Value and the proceeds of such sale plus (z) interest at the Overdue Rate plus
2% on all of the foregoing amounts from the date of such sale until the date
of payment. (Charters, Article 22)
 
                             THE PARENT GUARANTIES
 
  Pursuant to the Parent Guaranty with respect to each Vessel, Mobil has
irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the full and prompt payment of all
amounts payable by the Charterer under the related Charter, Participation
Agreement and each of the other related Operative Documents when and as the
same shall become due and payable. Each Parent Guaranty is an unsecured
obligation of Mobil and is enforceable without any need first to enforce the
related Charter against the Charterer.
 
                         THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS
 
  The Charterer is required to indemnify the related Owner Participant, Owner
Trust, Managing Trustee, Delaware Trustee, Indenture Trustee and the Pass
Through Trustee for certain losses, fees and expenses and for certain other
matters. (Participation Agreements, Section 13.1) In addition, the Charterer
is required to indemnify the related Owner Participant, the Owner Trust and
the Indenture Trustee for certain taxes in connection with the ownership,
charter, sale or use of the related Vessel. (Participation Agreements, Section
13.2) Subject to certain restrictions, the Owner Participant may transfer its
interest in a Vessel. (Participation Agreement, Section 14)
 
  If, on the applicable delivery date with respect to a Vessel, such Vessel
meets the requirements for delivery under the related Construction Contract,
delivery of such Vessel shall be accepted on the U.K. Lessor's behalf by the
supervisory agent pursuant to the Supervisory Agreement and title shall be
registered in the name of the related U.K. Lessor in the Marshall Islands (or
other jurisdiction designated by the Charterer, acceptable to the related
Owner Participant and not materially less favorable to the holders of the
related Secured Note).
 
                                     S-37

 
                              THE U.K. FINANCING
 
  In November 1997, each Owner Trust concluded a financing arrangement with
the U.K. Lessor pursuant to which, among other things, such Owner Trust
entered into the related Head Lease and certain related security documents
with respect to the Vessel which is the subject of the Charter to which it is
a party.
 
 Execution of Construction Contracts
 
  On November 24, 1997, the U.K. Lessor entered into each of the Construction
Contracts with the Builder, pursuant to which the U.K. Lessor will acquire
title to, and make installment payments for, the related Vessel. The contract
price of each Vessel is payable in installments as follows: 60% was paid
following the signing of the Construction Contract; 10% will be payable upon
laying of the keel; 10% will be payable at launching; and the remainder will
be due under the Construction Contract upon delivery and acceptance of such
Vessel. Certain additional costs with respect to the Construction Contract for
each Vessel have been and will be paid to the supervisory agent under the
related Supervisory Agreement. Each Vessel is subject to a Head Lease from the
U.K. Lessor to the related Owner Trust. In certain circumstances involving the
total loss of the related Vessel prior to its delivery or a default of the
Builder under the related Construction Contract, the Builder will be required
to refund amounts paid under such Construction Contract by the U.K. Lessor. In
such circumstances, the related Head Lease will be terminated and the related
Owner Trust will be required to pay certain specified amounts to the U.K.
Lessor. The Owner Trust's obligation to make such payment has been
unconditionally guaranteed by Mobil. Pursuant to the related Supervisory
Agreement, the Owner Trust is entitled to receive any such refund payments
from the Builder under the Construction Contract.
 
 Head Lease
 
  Pursuant to the terms of each Head Lease, the U.K. Lessor will lease the
Vessel to the applicable Owner Trust. The obligations under the Head Lease for
which the related Owner Trust is liable as lessee thereunder are
unconditionally guaranteed by Mobil pursuant to the U.K. Deed of Parent
Guaranty. The term of each Head Lease will expire on or after the maturity
date of the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. During the term
of each Head Lease following the closing of the Offering (the "Head Lease
Period") and for as long thereafter as certain sums remain due and payable
under the Head Lease, the U.K. Lessor will have the benefit of certain
security, including a letter of credit (the "Head Lease Support Letter of
Credit") issued by a bank (the "Head Lease Support Bank"), which will be
available for the payment of significant portions of rent and other sums
payable under such Head Lease. On November 24, 1997, the U.K. Lessor executed
the Construction Contracts and the Supervisory Agreements in respect of the
Vessels and thereafter paid the first installments thereunder to the Builder
and the supervisory agent, respectively. Immediately following the closing of
the Offering, the Owner Trust will deposit more than three-quarters of the net
proceeds of the sale of the related Secured Note with the Head Lease Support
Bank, which will issue a notice to the U.K. Lessor confirming that, effective
upon the date of such notice, the related Head Lease Support Letter of Credit
is in full force and effect, as required by the U.K. Documents. On each date
on which subsequent installment payments are due under the applicable
Construction Contract, the related Owner Trust will make a further deposit
with the Head Lease Support Bank, whereupon the Head Lease Support Bank will
increase the maximum amount available under the related Head Lease Support
Letter of Credit and will notify the U.K. Lessor of such increase. The U.K.
Lessor will then remit the installments to the Builder and the supervisory
agent. During the term of the Head Lease, following the issue of the notice
referred to above, the Head Lease Support Letter of Credit will be available
for the payment of rentals and other amounts due from the related Owner Trust
under the Head Lease.
 
                                     S-38

 
  Title to each Vessel will be delivered to the U.K. Lessor upon payment of
the final installment and acceptance of the Vessel by or on behalf of the U.K.
Lessor under the related Construction Contract. Each Head Lease will provide
the Owner Trust with certain rights in the related Vessel including, but not
limited to, the right to possession and use of the Vessel, the right to
charter the Vessel and, upon a termination of the Head Lease and sale of the
Vessel, the right to receive, after the payment of certain amounts determined
by reference to the Secured Notes (as described below) and certain amounts
payable to the U.K. Lessor under the Head Lease, the residual value of the
Vessel by way of rebate of rentals or sales agency commission.
 
  Under the terms of each Head Lease, the related Owner Trust is prohibited
from imposing liens (other than certain permitted liens) on the related Vessel
and is required to maintain certain operating standards pertaining to, among
other things, obtaining appropriate licenses and records, performing
appropriate maintenance and maintaining adequate insurance with respect to
such Vessel. In addition, pursuant to the terms of each Head Lease, the
related Owner Trust has agreed to indemnify the U.K. Lessor and certain
affiliated persons for all losses, including certain tax losses, which may be
suffered by them subject to certain exceptions. All obligations of the related
Owner Trust under each Head Lease have been unconditionally guaranteed by
Mobil under the U.K. Deed of Parent Guaranty and will be undertaken by the
Charterer.
 
  If an event of default under any Head Lease or certain other events,
including certain events involving defaults by the Builder under the related
Construction Contract, adverse changes in law or termination of the related
Charter, occurs and is continuing and has not been waived, the U.K. Lessor has
the right to terminate such Head Lease. If the Head Lease is terminated after
the Vessel has been delivered under the related Construction Contract, the
Vessel may be sold at a price not less than its open market value. Subject to
payment of a certain amount upon termination of such Head Lease, such sale
will be arranged by such Owner Trust or its designee as exclusive sales agent.
In any event, the net proceeds of such sale, if any, will be received by the
U.K. Lessor and applied as a priority in payment, by way of rebate of rentals
or sales agency commission, to such Owner Trust or the Indenture Trustee, as
the case may be, up to an amount equal to the lower of (a) the aggregate of
all amounts payable to the holder of the related Secured Note and any other
banks or financial institutions or pass-through trustees holding debt
obligations of the related Owner Trust in consideration of making loans or
other facilities available to such Owner Trust and (b) the aggregate of (i) an
agreed amount, which shall not be less than the principal amount of the
related Secured Notes scheduled to be outstanding at the date of such sale,
(ii) interest accrued on such principal amount since the last interest payment
date and (iii) the Make-Whole Amount, if any, payable with respect to the
prepayment of such principal amount. Under each Indenture, the related Owner
Trust will assign to the Indenture Trustee its right to receive such payment
upon a sale of the related Vessel under the related Head Lease. If the Head
Lease is terminated under circumstances entitling the Owner Trust to a refund
of amounts paid by the U.K. Lessor under the Construction Contract, the Owner
Trust will hold any such payment for the benefit of the U.K. Lessor, which has
directed that the Owner Trust apply such payment in the manner described in
the preceding sentence as applicable to sales proceeds of the Vessel.
 
 Security Arrangements
 
  In order to secure, among other things, the U.K. Lessor's obligation to
permit the sale of the related Vessel and rebate amounts in respect thereof to
the applicable Owner Trust, as described in the preceding paragraph, the U.K.
Lessor will, following delivery of the related Vessel, grant a mortgage to the
related Owner Trust on the related Vessel. The Indenture Trustee under the
related Indenture will receive an assignment from the related Owner Trust of
its right to receive proceeds resulting from the enforcement of the Owner
Trust's rights under such mortgage. Because of the novelty of these security
arrangements and the many jurisdictions potentially involved, there can be
 
                                     S-39

 
no assurance that the assortment of rights in the related Vessel which will
vest in the related Owner Trust and, indirectly, in the Indenture Trustee, on
behalf of the holder of the related Secured Note, would provide rights similar
to those held by a mortgagee under a conventional ship mortgage in the event
of an arrest of the related Vessel, a foreclosure under the related Indenture
or a proceeding in bankruptcy. However, Mobil's obligation under each Parent
Guaranty to make payments under the related Charter and the other related
Operative Documents, as well as its obligation under each U.K. Deed of Parent
Guaranty to make payments under certain U.K. Documents, should not be affected
by any early termination of the U.K. Financing.
 
  If a Head Lease were to terminate by reason of certain insolvency-related
events with respect to the U.K. Lessor or its guarantor, such Head Lease would
terminate and, upon payment of certain compensation payments to the related
U.K. Lessor by the related Owner Trust under such Head Lease (which liability
has been unconditionally guaranteed by Mobil), the U.K. Lessor's rights under
the related U.K. Documents would terminate and the U.K. Lessor would be
obligated to permit the sale of the Vessel by the Owner Trust or its designee
as exclusive sales agent, and would be obligated to apply the net proceeds of
any such sale as described under "Head Lease", above.
 
  Under the terms of each Charter, the sale of the related Vessel upon the
termination of the related Head Lease would constitute a Special Termination
Event under such Charter unless the purchaser of such Vessel agreed to assume
the Secured Note issued under the related Indenture. If a purchaser were to
agree to assume the obligations of the transferring Owner Trust under such
Indenture and other related Operative Documents and the other conditions set
forth therein were satisfied, including obtaining a confirmation of the
related Parent Guaranty, there would be no early repayment of the Secured Note
under such Indenture. See "Description of the Secured Notes--Substitution of
Obligor under Certain Circumstances."

                        FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
  The following is a general discussion of the anticipated material federal
income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Pass
Through Certificates by a Certificateholder. This summary is based on laws,
regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to
change by legislative, administrative or judicial action. The discussion below
does not purport to address federal income tax consequences applicable to
particular categories of investors, some of which (for example, insurance
companies or foreign investors) may be subject to special rules. The Pass
Through Trust is not indemnified for any federal income taxes that may be
imposed upon it, and the imposition of any such taxes could result in a
reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the Certificateholders
from the Pass Through Trust. In connection with the Offering, Mobil and the
Charterer will receive an opinion from Dewey Ballantine LLP, special counsel
to the Charterer and Mobil, that, based upon currently applicable law, the
following discussion properly describes in general the anticipated principal
United States federal income tax consequences of acquiring, holding and
disposing of the Pass Through Certificates.
 
  INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL, FOREIGN AND ANY OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE,
OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE PASS THROUGH CERTIFICATES, INCLUDING THE
ADVISABILITY OF MAKING ANY ELECTION DISCUSSED BELOW, IN LIGHT OF THEIR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
 General
 
  Based upon an interpretation of analogous authorities under currently
applicable law, the Pass Through Trust will be classified as a grantor trust
(and not as an association taxable as a corporation) and each
Certificateholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata undivided
interest in the Secured Notes and any other property held in the Pass Through
Trust. Each Certificateholder will be required to report on its federal income
tax return its pro rata share of the entire income (including interest
payments and original issue or market discount) from the Secured Notes and any
other property in the Pass Through Trust, in accordance with such
Certificateholder's method of accounting.
 
  Because the Pass Through Trust holds more than one Secured Note, a purchaser
of a Pass Through Certificate will be treated as purchasing an interest in
each Secured Note at a price determined by allocating the purchase price paid
for the Pass Through Certificate between such Secured Notes in proportion to
their fair market values at the time of purchase of the Pass Through
Certificate.
 
 Original Issue Discount
 
  The Secured Notes will be issued with original issue discount ("OID") in
excess of the de minimis amounts provided for by the Code. Accordingly, each
Certificateholder generally will be required to include OID in income on the
Secured Notes as it accrues under a constant yield method in advance of cash
payments attributable to such income (regardless of whether the
Certificateholder is a cash or accrual basis taxpayer).
 
  The amount of OID with respect to the Secured Notes will be the excess of
the "stated redemption price at maturity" of the Secured Notes over their
issue price. The "stated redemption price at maturity" of the Secured Notes
will include all cash payments required to be made on the Secured Notes (other
than qualified stated interest, which is generally defined as stated interest
that is payable at least annually at a single fixed rate or at certain
qualifying variable rates), whether denominated as principal or interest. The
issue price of the Secured Notes is the allocable portion of the first price
at which a substantial amount of Pass Through Certificates is sold to the
public for money and is expected to be that portion of the offering price set
forth in this Prospectus Supplement
 
                                     S-41

 
that the fair market value of the Secured Notes at the time of their purchase
bears to the offering price.
 
  Each Certificateholder will be required to include in gross income an amount
equal to the sum of the daily portions of OID for each day during the taxable
year in which the Secured Notes are held. The daily portion of OID is
determined by allocating to each day in an accrual period the pro rata portion
of the OID that is allocable to the accrual period. The amount of OID that is
allocable to an accrual period will be determined by multiplying the adjusted
issue price of the Secured Notes allocable to the Certificateholder at the
beginning of the accrual period by the yield to maturity of such Secured
Notes. The adjusted issue price of the Secured Notes allocable to the
Certificateholder at the beginning of an accrual period will be equal to their
issue price increased by all previously accrued OID and reduced by the amount
of all previous payments (other than payments of qualified stated interest).
The yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used to compute the
present value of payments to be made under the Secured Notes, produces an
amount equal to the issue price of the Secured Notes. Actual interest payments
(other than payments of qualified stated interest) will not be taxable upon
receipt as such but will be treated as payments of previously accrued OID.
 
  The Pass Through Trustee will report annually to the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") and Certificateholders of record the amount of OID accrued
with respect to the Secured Notes.
 
 Sales of Pass Through Certificates
 
  A Certificateholder that sells a Pass Through Certificate will generally
recognize gain or loss (in the aggregate) equal to the difference between the
amount realized on the sale (except to the extent attributable to accrued
interest, which will be taxable as interest income) and the
Certificateholder's adjusted tax basis in the Pass Through Certificate. A
Certificateholder's adjusted tax basis in a Pass Through Certificate generally
will be equal to the price paid by such Certificateholder for such Pass
Through Certificate increased by the portion of OID previously included in
gross income to the date of disposition (and accrued market discount, if any)
and decreased by any cash payments (other than payments of qualified stated
interest) regardless of whether such payments are denominated as interest or
principal. Subject to the market discount provisions of the Code (described
below), any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the Pass Through
Certificate was held as a capital asset and, if the Pass Through Certificate
was held for more than one year, will be long-term capital gain or loss. Any
long-term capital gains realized will be taxable to corporate taxpayers at the
rates applicable to ordinary income and to individual taxpayers as follows:
(1) if held for more than one year but not more than 18 months, as at maximum
rate of 28%; and (2) if held for more than 18 months, at a maximum rate of
20%. Any capital losses realized will be deductible by a corporate taxpayer
only to the extent of capital gains and by an individual taxpayer only to the
extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income.
 
 Market Discount
 
  In general, a purchaser of a Pass Through Certificate (other than an
original purchaser of a Pass Through Certificate at the offering price set
forth in this Prospectus Supplement) will be considered to have acquired an
interest in a Pass Through Certificate at a "market discount" to the extent
the issue price of the Pass Through Certificate plus the amount of OID
includible in income by all prior Certificateholders of the Pass Through
Certificate exceeds the purchaser's tax basis allocable to such Pass Through
Certificate, unless the excess does not exceed a prescribed de minimis amount.
In the event such excess exceeds the de minimis amount, the Certificateholder
will be subject to the market discount rules with regard to its interest in
the Pass Through Certificate.
 
  In the case of a sale or other disposition of a Pass Through Certificate
subject to the market discount rules, gain, if any, from such sale or
disposition must be treated as ordinary income to the extent such gain
represents market discount that has accrued during the period in which the
Pass
 
                                     S-42

 
Through Certificate was held. If such Pass Through Certificate is disposed of
in a nontaxable transaction, the accrued market discount (subject to certain
exceptions) will be includible in ordinary income as if the Certificateholder
had sold the Pass Through Certificate at its then market value.
 
  In the case of a partial principal payment on a Pass Through Certificate
subject to the market discount rules, such payment must be included in gross
income as ordinary income to the extent such payment does not exceed the
market discount that has accrued during the period such Pass Through
Certificate was held. The amount of any accrued market discount later required
to be included in income upon a disposition or subsequent partial principal
payment will be reduced by the amount of accrued market discount previously
included in income.
 
  Pursuant to the Conference Committee Report to the Tax Reform Act of 1986
(the "Conference Report") and until Treasury regulations are issued, because
the Secured Notes are amortizing obligations and have OID, Certificateholders
that acquire Pass Through Certificates with market discount may elect to
accrue market discount either on the basis of a constant interest rate or in
proportion to the accrual of OID for the applicable accrual period (i.e., the
amount of market discount that accrues during a period is equal to the product
of (a) the total remaining market discount and (b) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the OID for the period and the denominator of which is the total
remaining OID at the beginning of the period).
 
  If, in any taxable year, interest paid or accrued on a loan incurred or
continued to purchase or carry a Pass Through Certificate subject to the
market discount rules exceeds the interest currently includible in income with
respect to such Pass Through Certificate, deduction of the excess interest
must be deferred to the extent of the market discount allocable to the taxable
year. The deferred portion of any interest expense generally will be
deductible when such market discount is included in income upon the sale or
other disposition (including repayment) of the Pass Through Certificate.
 
  A taxpayer may elect to include market discount in its gross income
currently. If such election is made, it shall apply to all market discount
bonds acquired by the taxpayer on or after the first day of the first taxable
year for which such election applies and for all subsequent periods. The rules
described above regarding the treatment of certain gain as ordinary income and
the deferral of interest expense will not apply to the taxpayer if such an
election is made.
 
 Premium
 
  In general, a subsequent purchaser of a Pass Through Certificate who
purchases the Pass Through Certificate for an amount less than the sum of all
amounts (other than qualified stated interest) payable on the Secured Notes
after the purchase date but greater than their adjusted issue price
immediately before such purchase (i.e., a purchase at a "premium") also will
be required to include in gross income the sum of the daily portions of OID on
the Secured Notes. In computing the daily portions of OID for such a
purchaser, however, the daily portion of OID is reduced by a portion of the
premium equal to the product of (A) the daily portion of OID for such day
(computed in accordance with the rules set forth above) and (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount, if any, by which the Certificateholder's
basis in the Secured Notes on the date of acquisition exceeds the Secured
Notes' adjusted issue price at that time, and the denominator of which is the
sum of all amounts (other than qualified stated interest) payable on the
Secured Notes after the date of acquisition reduced by the Secured Notes'
adjusted issue price.
 
 Backup Withholding
 
  Payments made on the Pass Through Certificates, and proceeds from the sale
of the Pass Through Certificates to or through certain brokers, may be subject
to a "backup" withholding tax of 31% unless the Certificateholder complies
with certain reporting procedures or is exempt from such
 
                                     S-43

 
requirements. Any such withheld amounts are allowed as a credit against the
Certificateholder's federal income tax and may entitle such Certificateholder
to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.
Furthermore, certain penalties may be imposed by the IRS on a
Certificateholder who is required to supply information but who does not do so
in the proper manner.
 
                             ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
 
  Pass Through Certificates may be purchased by an employee benefit plan (a
"Plan") subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"). A fiduciary of a Plan must determine that the purchase of a
Pass Through Certificate is consistent with its fiduciary duties under ERISA
and does not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Employee benefit plans which
are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain
church plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) are not subject to the
fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. Any Plan that purchases a Pass
Through Certificate must be an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501(a)(1) of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act").
 
The United States Department of Labor (the "DOL") has granted to Salomon
Brothers Inc an administrative exemption (Prohibited Transaction Exemption 89-
89 et al., Exemption Application No. D-6446 et al., 54 Fed. Reg. 42,589
(1989)) (the "Exemption") from certain of the prohibited transaction rules of
ERISA and the Code with respect to the initial purchase, the holding, and the
subsequent resale by a Plan (including an individual retirement account or
other plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code) of certificates in certain
pass through trusts, the assets of which pass through trust consist of secured
credit instruments that bear interest or are purchased at a discount in
transactions by or between business entities (including, but not limited to,
qualified equipment notes secured by leases). The limited relief provided by
the DOL in the Exemption from certain provisions of ERISA and the Code is
subject to several other conditions, including a requirement that certificates
acquired by a Plan under the Exemption have received a rating at the time of
acquisition by the Plan that is in one of the three highest rating categories
from either Standard & Poor's Rating Group, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. or Duff & Phelps Inc. The Exemption also
requires that the acquisition of certificates by a Plan be on terms (including
the price for the Pass Through Certificates) that are at least as favorable to
a Plan as they would be in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated
party. The Exemption only permits the assets of a pass through trust to
include a prefunding account under certain limited circumstances. The
prefunding restrictions may not be applicable where the assets of a pass
through trust are specifically identified as of the closing date, but are not
transferred to the trust until shortly after the closing date for
administrative or other reasons.
 
  Each fiduciary of a Plan should independently determine if its purchase or
holding of a Pass Through Certificate will require an exemption, and if so,
whether the Exemption applies to such purchase or holding, or whether any
other prohibited transaction exemption is available.
 
  A fiduciary should also consider that, under regulations promulgated by the
DOL, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (the "Regulation"), if a Plan acquires a
Pass Through Certificate, then the Plan's assets may include both the Pass
Through Certificate it acquires and an undivided interest in the underlying
assets of the related Pass Through Trust (because such Pass Through Trust is
deemed to hold assets of the Plan), unless the actual level of investment by
employee benefit plans (and certain entities in which employee benefit plans
invest) in the Pass Through Certificates is not "significant" within the
meaning of the Regulation.
 
  Under the terms of the Regulation, if a Pass Through Trust were deemed to
hold assets of an employee benefit plan by reason of a Plan's investment in a
Pass Through Certificate, such Plan
 
                                     S-44

 
assets would include an undivided interest in the Pass Through Trust, the
Secured Notes and other assets held by the Pass Through Trust. In such an
event, the persons providing services with respect to the assets of the Pass
Through Trust, including the Secured Notes, may be subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and be subject to the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to transactions
involving such assets, unless such transactions are subject to a statutory or
administrative exemption. The Exemption may provide prohibited transaction
relief under these circumstances.
 
  Insurance companies considering the purchase of Pass Through Certificates
should also consult their own counsel as to the application of the decision by
the United States Supreme Court in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 114 S. Ct. 517 (1993) to such a purchase. Under
that decision, assets held in an insurance company's general account may be
deemed plan assets under certain circumstances.
 
  The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all
inclusive. Any fiduciary of a Plan considering the purchase of Pass Through
Certificates should consult its legal advisors regarding the consequences of
such purchase under ERISA and the Code (and, particularly in the case of non-
ERISA plans, concerning any state law consideration).
 
                                 UNDERWRITING
 
  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement
with Mobil and MEFC (the "Underwriting Agreement"), Salomon Brothers Inc (the
"Underwriter") has agreed to purchase from the Pass Through Trustee
$61,400,000 aggregate accreted principal amount of Pass Through Certificates.
 
  The Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligation of the Underwriter
to pay for and accept delivery of the Pass Through Certificates is subject to
the approval of certain legal matters by its counsel and to certain other
conditions. The Underwriter is obligated to take and pay for all of the Pass
Through Certificates if any are taken.
 
  The Underwriter initially proposes to offer all or part of the Pass Through
Certificates directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on
the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement and may offer a portion of the
Pass Through Certificates to dealers at a price which represents a concession
not in excess of .35%. The Underwriter may allow, and such dealers may
reallow, a concession not in excess of the .25% for certain dealers. After the
initial public offering, the public offering prices and such concessions may
from time to time be varied by the Underwriter.
 
  Mobil and MEFC have each agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.
 
  Mobil does not intend to apply for listing of the Pass Through Certificates
on a national securities exchange, but has been advised by the Underwriter
that it presently intends to make a market in the Pass Through Certificates,
as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The Underwriter is not
obligated, however, to make a market in the Pass Through Certificates and any
such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of
the Underwriter. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity
of, or trading markets for, the Pass Through Certificates.
 
  The Underwriter and certain of its affiliates perform investment banking and
other financial services for Mobil and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business.
 
  During and after the Offering, the Underwriter may purchase and sell the
Pass Through Certificates in the open market. These transactions may include
overallotment and stabilizing
 
                                     S-45

 
transactions and purchases to cover short positions created in connection with
the Offering. The Underwriter also may impose a penalty bid, whereby selling
concessions allowed to broker-dealers in respect of the Pass Through
Certificates sold in the Offering for their account may be reclaimed by the
Underwriter if such Pass Through Certificates are repurchased by the
Underwriter in stabilizing or covering transactions. These activities may
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Pass Through
Certificates which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail
in the open market, and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
 
                                 LEGAL MATTERS
 
  The validity of the Pass Through Certificates offered hereby will be passed
upon for Mobil and MEFC by Ralph N. Johanson, Jr., Managing Counsel,
Corporate, Finance and Securities of Mobil, and by Dewey Ballantine LLP, New
York, New York, and for the underwriters by Shearman & Sterling, New York, New
York. Dewey Ballantine LLP and Shearman & Sterling will rely on the opinion of
Bingham Dana LLP, counsel for the Pass Through Trustee, as to certain matters
relating to the authorization, execution and delivery of such Pass Through
Certificates by, and the valid and binding effect thereof on, the Pass Through
Trustee.

  Up to $650,000,000 aggregate public offering price of Pass Through
Certificates (the "Certificates") (or its equivalent (based on the applicable
exchange rate at the time of sale) in one or more foreign currencies or units
based on or related to currencies, including European Currency Units) may be
offered for sale from time to time pursuant to this Prospectus and related
Prospectus Supplements (as defined below). Certificates may be issued in one
or more series in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time
of the offering. In respect of each offering of Certificates, a separate Mobil
Pass Through Trust for each series of Certificates being offered (each, a
"Pass Through Trust") will be formed pursuant to a Pass Through Trust
Agreement (the "Basic Agreement"), among Mobil Marine Finance Company I Inc.,
Mobil Marine Finance Company II Inc., Mobil Lease Finance Company Inc., Mobil
Chemical Finance (Texas) Inc., Mobil Chemical Finance (Louisiana) Inc., Mobil
Petrorail Finance Inc., Mobil Transport Finance Company Inc., Mobil Equipment
Finance Company Inc. (each, a "Lessee"), Mobil Corporation ("Mobil") and State
Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Trustee"), as trustee under each Pass
Through Trust, and a supplement thereto (each, a "Trust Supplement") relating
to such Pass Through Trust to be entered into among one or more of the
Lessees, Mobil and the Trustee. Each Certificate in a series will represent a
fractional undivided interest in the related Pass Through Trust and will have
no rights, benefits or interests in respect of any other Pass Through Trust.
The property of each Pass Through Trust will consist of notes (the "Secured
Notes") issued on a nonrecourse basis by one or more owner trustees (each, an
"Owner Trustee") of one or more separate owner trusts (each, an "Owner Trust")
in connection with one or more separate leveraged lease transactions to
finance or refinance all or a portion of the cost of certain real or personal
property to be specified in a Prospectus Supplement, which property may
consist of title to, an estate for years or a leasehold or similar interest in
equipment, manufacturing, drilling or production facilities, marine tankers,
rail cars, corporate aircraft (including engines), drilling platforms,
refineries, pipelines, chemical plants, and other real or personal property or
undivided interests therein (each such specified property, "Leased Property").
Each Leased Property has been or will be leased or chartered to a Lessee
pursuant to separate lease agreements, sublease agreements, charters or
similar agreements (each, a "Lease"). Although neither the Certificates nor
the Secured Notes will be obligations of, or guaranteed by, any Lessee or
Mobil, the amounts unconditionally payable under the Lease or Leases related
to a Pass Through Trust will be at least sufficient to pay in full when due
all payments of principal and interest and, except in the limited
circumstances set forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, premium, if
any, due in respect of the Secured Notes held in that Pass Through Trust.
Mobil will fully and unconditionally guarantee (in each case pursuant to a
"Parent Guaranty") to the holders of Certificates from time to time the full
and prompt payment of amounts payable by the Lessee under a related Lease when
and as the same shall become due and payable.
 
  The specific terms of the particular Certificates in respect of which this
Prospectus is being delivered will be set forth in a supplement to this
Prospectus (each, a "Prospectus Supplement") which will be delivered together
with this Prospectus, and which will include, where applicable, the specific
designation, form, aggregate principal amount, initial public offering price
and distribution dates relating to such Certificates, the currency in which
such Certificates will be payable, and the use of the net proceeds from the
offering of such Certificates. The

 
Prospectus Supplement will also describe the Pass Through Trust or Pass
Through Trusts relating to such Certificates, the Secured Notes to be
purchased by such Pass Through Trust or Pass Through Trusts, each Leased
Property relating to such Secured Notes, the leveraged lease transactions
relating to such Secured Notes and other special terms relating to such
Certificates.
 
  If so specified in a Prospectus Supplement related to an offering of
Certificates, the Trust Property (as defined below) of a Pass Through Trust
will consist of Secured Notes related to Leased Property which are
subordinated in right of payment to other Secured Notes related to the same
Leased Property. In respect of such offering, only Secured Notes having the
same priority of payment may be held in the same Pass Through Trust. In
addition, the related Prospectus Supplement may provide that the Trustees on
behalf of the applicable Pass Through Trusts may enter into an intercreditor
or subordination agreement establishing priorities among series of
Certificates or that one or more payments of interest on the related Secured
Notes of one or more series or distributions made by the Trustee of the
related Pass Through Trust will be supported by a liquidity facility issued by
an institution identified in the related Prospectus Supplement.
 
  Secured Notes may be issued in respect of one or more items of Leased
Property. Secured Notes in respect of a particular item of Leased Property may
be issued in one or more series, each of which may have a different interest
rate and different final maturity dates. For each series of Certificates, the
Trustee will purchase one or more Secured Notes issued with respect to one or
more items of Leased Property such that all of the Secured Notes held in the
related Pass Through Trust will have identical interest rates (in each case
equal to the rate applicable to the Certificates issued by such Pass Through
Trust), and such that the latest maturity date for such Secured Notes will
occur on or before the final distribution date for such Certificates. Interest
paid on the Secured Notes held in each Pass Through Trust will be passed
through to the holders of the Certificates relating to such Pass Through Trust
on the dates and at the rate per annum set forth in the Prospectus Supplement
relating to such Certificates until the final distribution date for such Pass
Through Trust. Principal paid on the Secured Notes held in each Pass Through
Trust will be passed through to the holders of the Certificates relating to
such Pass Through Trust in scheduled amounts on the dates set forth in the
Prospectus Supplement relating to such Certificates until the final
distribution date for such Pass Through Trust. The Secured Notes to be held in
a Pass Through Trust will be secured by (i) an assignment of certain of the
issuing Owner Trustee's rights as lessor or charterer under the Lease relating
to the Leased Property to which such Secured Notes relate, including the right
to receive rentals and certain other payments from the Lessee, (ii) an
assignment of certain of such Owner Trustee's rights under the Parent Guaranty
relating to such Leased Property and (iii) to the extent specified in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement, a mortgage or other security interest in
such Leased Property or in construction contracts or other agreements,
collateral accounts or other security, in each case subject to the rights of
the Lessee under the related Lease and other rights, if any, described in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
  The Certificates may be sold to or through underwriters, through dealers or
agents or directly to purchasers. See "Plan of Distribution." Each Prospectus
Supplement will set forth the names of any underwriters, dealers or agents
involved in the sale of the Certificates in respect of which that Prospectus
Supplement is being delivered, the proposed amounts, if any, to be purchased
by underwriters and the compensation, if any, of such underwriters or agents.
See "Plan of Distribution" for information concerning secondary trading of the
Certificates.

                             AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 
  Mobil and the Lessees have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (together with any
amendments thereto, the "Registration Statement") under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to
Certificates offered hereby. This Prospectus, which constitutes a part of the
Registration Statement, omits certain information contained in the
Registration Statement as permitted by the rules and regulations of the
Commission. For further information with respect to Mobil, the Lessees or the
Certificates offered hereby, reference is made to the Registration Statement,
exhibits, financial statements, notes and schedules filed as part thereof,
which may be inspected at the public reference facilities of the Commission at
the addresses set forth below. Statements made in this Prospectus as to the
contents of any contract, agreement or other document referred to are not
necessarily complete. With respect to each such contract, agreement or other
document filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, reference is made
to the exhibit for a more complete description of the document or matter
involved, and each such statement made herein with respect to such contract,
agreement or document shall be deemed qualified in its entirety by such
reference.
 
  Mobil is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and in accordance therewith
files reports and other information with the Commission. The Registration
Statement, as well as such reports and other information filed by Mobil
pursuant to the Exchange Act, may be inspected and copied (at prescribed
rates) at the public reference facilities maintained by the Commission at Room
1024, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, and at the Regional
Offices of the Commission at 7 World Trade Center, Suite 1300, New York, New
York 10048 and at 500 West Madison Street, Suite 1400, Chicago, Illinois
60661. The Commission also maintains a site on the World Wide Web at
http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and
other information filed electronically by Mobil. In addition, such reports,
proxy statements and other information may be inspected at the offices of the
New York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005, upon which
the common stock of Mobil is traded.
 
  No separate financial statements of any of the Lessees have been included or
incorporated by reference herein. Mobil and the Lessees do not consider that
such financial statements would be material to holders of the Certificates
because (i) all of the voting securities of each Lessee will be owned,
directly or indirectly, by Mobil, a reporting company under the Exchange Act,
(ii) each of the Lessees is a newly-formed special purpose entity, has no
independent operations and will not engage in any activity other than leasing
Leased Property and (iii) the obligations of each of the Lessees are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by Mobil as and to the extent described herein. See
"The Lessees," "Description of the Certificates," and "Parent Guaranties."

                            FORMATION OF THE TRUSTS
 
  In respect of each offering of Certificates, a separate Pass Through Trust
for each series of Certificates being offered will be formed pursuant to the
Basic Agreement and a Trust Supplement to be entered into among Mobil, the
Trustee and one or more Lessees (each Lessee that is liable under one or more
related Leases, an "Applicable Lessee"). Following the execution and delivery
of a Trust Supplement, the Trustee, on behalf of the related Pass Through
Trust, will purchase the Secured Notes to be held in such Pass Through Trust
having an interest rate (or, in the case of Secured Notes with a zero coupon,
accrual rate) equal to the interest rate (or accrual rate) applicable to the
Certificates evidencing interests in such Pass Through Trust. The maturity
date of the Secured Notes acquired by a Pass Through Trust will occur not
later than the final scheduled distribution date applicable to the
Certificates evidencing an interest in such Pass Through Trust. The Trustee
will distribute all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest
received by it as holder of such Secured Notes to the holders of Certificates
evidencing an interest in the Pass Through Trust in which such Secured Notes
are held. See "Description of the Certificates."
 
                   OUTLINE OF THE LEVERAGED LEASE STRUCTURE
 
  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
Certificates offered pursuant to any Prospectus Supplement will be issued to
facilitate the acquisition by one or more Owner Trustees, each acting not in
its individual capacity (except as expressly set forth in such Prospectus
Supplement) but solely as trustee under a separate trust agreement (each, an
"Owner Trust Agreement") for one or more equity investors (each, an "Owner
Participant"), of certain items of Leased Property. Owner Participants may
include affiliates of Mobil. Not later than the delivery date of the
applicable Leased Property to an Owner Trustee, such Owner Trustee will lease
or charter such Leased Property to a Lessee pursuant to a separate Lease. Such
Lessee may initially sublease or subcharter such Leased Property to an
affiliate of Mobil.
 
  The Owner Trustees will obtain a portion of the funding for the Leased
Property from the equity investments of the related Owner Participants, which
will be the beneficiaries of the related Owner Trusts, and will obtain the
remainder of the funding from the issuance on a non-recourse basis of the
Secured Notes to be held in the related Pass Through Trusts and, to the extent
set forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, additional debt secured by
such Leased Property or other sources. The Secured Notes to be held in the
Pass Through Trusts will be acquired by the Trustee with the proceeds from the
sale of Certificates.
 
                                       5

 
  Secured Notes relating to a particular Leased Property will be issued under
a separate indenture and security agreement or a similar agreement (each, an
"Indenture") with respect to such Leased Property. Each Indenture will be
entered into by and among a financial institution (the "Corporate Indenture
Trustee") and, where required by applicable law, an individual who may be an
officer or employee of the Corporate Indenture Trustee (the "Individual
Indenture Trustee"), as trustees thereunder (the Corporate Indenture Trustee
and the Individual Indenture Trustee, in such capacities, the "Indenture
Trustees"), and the issuing Owner Trustee. No Owner Trustee or Owner
Participant will be personally liable for any amount payable under the related
Indenture or the Secured Notes issued thereunder.
 
  The Secured Notes issued under each Indenture and held in each Pass Through
Trust will be secured by (i) an assignment of certain of the related Owner
Trustee's rights as lessor or charterer under the Lease with respect to the
applicable Leased Property, including the right to receive certain rentals and
other payments from the Applicable Lessee, (ii) an assignment of certain of
such Owner Trustee's rights under the Parent Guaranty relating to such Leased
Property, and (iii) to the extent specified in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement, a mortgage or other security interest in such Leased Property, or
in construction contracts or other agreements, collateral accounts or other
security, in each case subject to the rights of the Applicable Lessee under
the related Lease and other rights, if any, described in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. (Such security with respect to each Indenture shall be
referred to as the "Indenture Estate.") Unless otherwise set forth in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement, the Secured Notes issued under an Indenture
will not be secured by any of the Leased Properties securing the Secured Notes
issued under any other Indenture (including any other Leased Properties
acquired by the related Owner Trustee) and will not be cross-defaulted with
Secured Notes issued under any other Indenture (including any other Indenture
entered into by such Owner Trustee).
 
  The rents and other amounts payable by the Applicable Lessee under the
related Lease will be sufficient to pay in full when due all payments of
principal and interest and, except in the limited circumstances set forth in
the applicable Prospectus Supplement, premium, if any, due in respect of the
Secured Notes issued under the Indenture. The Secured Notes will not be
recourse obligations of any Owner Participant or issuing Owner Trustee, but
will be payable solely from the rents or charter hire and other amounts
payable under the Lease of the Leased Property securing such Secured Notes and
amounts realized from the exercise of the Indenture Trustee's remedies under
the Indenture against the related Indenture Estate. Pursuant to a Parent
Guaranty, Mobil will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and prompt
payments payable by the Applicable Lessee under the related Lease when and as
the same shall become due and payable. See "Description of the Secured Notes."
 
                                USE OF PROCEEDS
 
  The Certificates offered pursuant to this Prospectus and a related
Prospectus Supplement will be issued in order to facilitate the financing or
refinancing of all or a portion of the cost of certain Leased Property
specified in such Prospectus Supplement. The proceeds from the sale of
Certificates in respect of such Leased Property is not expected to exceed 90%
of the value of such Leased Property at the time of financing or refinancing,
which may be established by appraisal or by reference to its original cost.
Except as set forth in a Prospectus Supplement for a specific offering of
Certificates, the proceeds from the sale of the Certificates will be used by
the Trustee or Trustees on behalf of the applicable Pass Through Trust or Pass
Through Trusts to purchase Secured Notes. See "Description of the
Certificates" and "Description of the Secured Notes." In the event that, at
the time Certificates are issued, the Secured Notes to be purchased by the
applicable Pass Through Trust or Pass Through Trusts are not available for
purchase, the proceeds of the sale of such Certificates may be used by the
Trustee to purchase certain limited investments on an interim basis,
 
                                       6

 
as described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. In such event, any
portion of the proceeds of the sale of such Certificates not used for the
purchase of Secured Notes on or prior to the date set forth in such Prospectus
Supplement will be distributed on a Special Distribution Date (as defined
below) to the applicable Certificateholders, together with interest, but
without premium. See "Description of the Certificates--Delayed Purchase."

                        DESCRIPTION OF THE CERTIFICATES
 
  In connection with each offering of Certificates, one or more separate Pass
Through Trusts will be formed and one or more series of Certificates will be
issued pursuant to the Basic Agreement and one or more separate Trust
Supplements to be entered into among Mobil, the Applicable Lessee or
Applicable Lessees and the Trustee on behalf of the related Pass Through
Trust. The statements made under this caption are summaries and do not purport
to be complete. Reference is made to, and the summaries are qualified in their
entirety by reference to, the detailed provisions of the Basic Agreement, the
form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of
which this Prospectus is a part and which will be qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The summaries
relate to the Basic Agreement to be entered into and each of the Trust
Supplements, the Pass Through Trusts to be formed thereby and the Certificates
to be issued by each Pass Through Trust except to the extent, if any,
described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. Reference is also made to,
and the summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to, the
detailed provisions of the form of Parent Guaranty, which has been filed as an
exhibit to the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is a part. The
Trust Supplement relating to each series of Certificates and the forms of the
related Indenture, Lease, Participation Agreement or similar agreements will
be filed as exhibits to a post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part, a Current Report on Form 8-K, a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable,
to be filed by Mobil with the Commission.
 
  The Certificates offered pursuant to this Prospectus will be limited to
$650,000,000 aggregate public offering price (or its equivalent (based on the
applicable exchange rate at the time of sale) in one or more foreign
currencies or units based on or related to currencies, including European
Currency Units).
 
  Certain provisions of the description of the Certificates in this Prospectus
do not necessarily apply to one Certificate of each Pass Through Trust which
may be issued in a denomination of less than $1,000.
 
  To the extent that any provision in any Prospectus Supplement is
inconsistent with any provision in this summary, the provision of such
Prospectus Supplement will control.
 
GENERAL
 
  Each Certificate will represent a fractional undivided interest in the Pass
Through Trust created by the Trust Supplement pursuant to which such
Certificate was issued and all payments and distributions shall be made only
from the related Trust Property (as defined below). The property of each Pass
Through Trust (the "Trust Property") will include the Secured Notes held in
such Pass Through Trust, all monies at any time paid thereon and all monies
due and to become due thereunder and funds from time to time deposited with
the Trustee in accounts relating to such Pass Through Trust. Each Certificate
will represent a pro rata share of the outstanding principal amount of the
Secured Notes held in the related Pass Through Trust and, unless otherwise
specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, will be issued in minimum
denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Certificates do
not represent an interest in or obligation of Mobil, any Lessee, the Trustee,
any of the Indenture Trustees or Owner Trustees in their individual
capacities, any Owner Participant, or any of their respective affiliates. Each
Certificateholder by its acceptance of a Certificate agrees to look solely to
the income and proceeds from the Trust Property as provided in the Basic
Agreement and the applicable Trust Supplement.
 
  No holder of a Certificate issued with respect to a Pass Through Trust will
have any rights, benefits or interests in respect of any other Pass Through
Trust or in the property held by any other
 
                                       8

 
Pass Through Trust. All payments and distributions on the Certificates will be
made only from the related Trust Property, or pursuant to intercreditor,
subordination or similar agreements to which the related Trustee may be a
party.
 
  Secured Notes issued under an Indenture may be held in more than one Pass
Through Trust and one Pass Through Trust may hold Secured Notes issued under
more than one Indenture.
 
  Interest will be passed through to Certificateholders of each Pass Through
Trust at the rate per annum payable on the Secured Notes held in such Pass
Through Trust, as set forth for such Pass Through Trust on the cover page of
the applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
  None of the Basic Agreement, the Indentures nor the Leases will include
financial covenants or "event risk" provisions that would afford
Certificateholders protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other
transaction involving Mobil or the Lessees. The Certificateholders will have
the benefit of a lien on the Leased Property and the other property in each
Indenture Estate securing the Secured Notes held in the related Pass Through
Trust, as discussed under "Description of the Secured Notes--Security."
 
  Reference is made to the Prospectus Supplement that accompanies this
Prospectus for a description of the specific series of Certificates being

Certificates will be set forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
BOOK-ENTRY REGISTRATION
 
 General
 
  If specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the Certificates
issued thereunder will be subject to the provisions described below and under
the caption "--Definitive Certificates." Upon issuance, each series of
Certificates will be represented by one fully registered global certificate.
Each global certificate will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and registered in the name of Cede & Co.
("Cede"), or its nominee. No person acquiring an interest in such Certificates
("Certificate Owner") will be entitled to receive a certificate representing
such person's interest in such Certificates, except as set forth below under
"--Definitive Certificates." Unless and until Definitive Certificates (as
defined below) are issued under the limited circumstances described herein and
in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, all references to actions by
Certificateholders shall refer to actions taken by DTC upon instructions from
DTC Participants (as defined below), and all references herein to
distributions, notices, reports and statements to Certificateholders shall
refer, as the case may be, to distributions, notices, reports and statements
to DTC or Cede, as the registered holder of such Certificates, or to DTC
Participants for distribution to Certificate Owners in accordance with DTC
procedures.
 
  DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State
of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation"
within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a "clearing
agency" registered pursuant to section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds
securities for its participants ("DTC Participants") and facilitates the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between DTC Participants
through electronic computerized book-entries in DTC Participants' accounts,
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. DTC
Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and clearing corporations. Indirect access to the DTC system also is available
to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant either
directly or indirectly ("Indirect Participants").
 
  Certificate Owners that are not DTC Participants or Indirect Participants
but desire to purchase, sell or otherwise transfer ownership of, or other
interests in, the Certificates may do so only through DTC Participants and
Indirect Participants. In addition, Certificate Owners will receive all
distributions of principal and interest from the Trustee through DTC
Participants or Indirect Participants, as the case may be. Under a book-entry
format, Certificate Owners may experience some delay in their receipt of
payments, because such payments will be forwarded by the Trustee to Cede, as
nominee for DTC. DTC will forward such payments in same-day funds to DTC
Participants who are credited with ownership of the Certificates in amounts
proportionate to the principal amount of each such DTC Participant's
respective holdings of beneficial interests in the Certificates. DTC
Participants will thereafter forward payments to Indirect Participants or
Certificate Owners, as the case may be, in accordance with customary industry
practices. The forwarding of such distributions to the Certificate Owners will
be the responsibility of such DTC Participants. Unless and until the
Definitive Certificates are issued under the limited circumstances described
herein, the only "Certificateholder" will be Cede, as nominee of DTC.
Certificate Owners will not be recognized by the Trustee as
Certificateholders, as such term is used in the Basic Agreement, and
Certificate Owners will be permitted to exercise the rights of
Certificateholders only indirectly through DTC and DTC Participants.
 
  Under the rules, regulations and procedures creating and affecting DTC and
its operations (the "Rules"), DTC is required to make book-entry transfers of
the Certificates among DTC Participants
 
                                      10

 
on whose behalf it acts with respect to the Certificates and to receive and
transmit to DTC Participants distributions of principal, premium, if any, and
interest with respect to the Certificates. DTC Participants and Indirect
Participants with which Certificate Owners have accounts with respect to the
Certificates similarly are required to make book-entry transfers and receive
and transmit such payments on behalf of their respective customers.
Accordingly, although Certificate Owners will not possess the Certificates,
the Rules provide a mechanism by which Certificate Owners will receive
payments and will be able to transfer their interests.
 
  Because DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on
behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Certificate Owner to pledge
the Certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC
system, or to otherwise act with respect to such Certificates, may be limited
due to the lack of a physical certificate for such Certificates.
 
  DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a Certificateholder under
the Basic Agreement only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants to
whose accounts with DTC the Certificates are credited. Additionally, in the
event any action requires approval by Certificateholders of a certain
percentage of beneficial interest in each Pass Through Trust, DTC will take
such action only at the direction of and on behalf of DTC Participants whose
holders include undivided interests that satisfy any such percentage. DTC may
take conflicting actions with respect to other undivided interests to the
extent that such actions are taken on behalf of DTC Participants whose holders
include such undivided interests.
 
  None of Mobil, the Lessees or the Trustee will have any liability for any
aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interests in the Certificates held by Cede, as nominee for DTC, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such
beneficial ownership interests.
 
  The applicable Prospectus Supplement will specify any additional book-entry
registration procedures applicable to Certificates denominated in a currency
other than United States dollars.
 
  The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system
has been attained from sources that Mobil believes to be reliable, but neither
Mobil nor any Lessee has independently verified such information or takes
responsibility for its accuracy.
 
 Definitive Certificates
 
  Certificates will be issued in fully registered certificated form
("Definitive Certificates") to Certificate Owners or their nominees, rather
than to DTC or its nominee, only if (i) the Applicable Lessee advises the
Trustee in writing that DTC is no longer willing or able to discharge properly
its responsibilities as depository with respect to such Certificates and the
Trustee or such Lessee is unable to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the
Applicable Lessee, at its option, elects to terminate the book-entry system
through DTC or (iii) after the occurrence of certain events of default or
other events specified in the related Prospectus Supplement, Certificate
Owners of Certificates evidencing fractional undivided interests aggregating
not less than a majority in interest in the related Pass Through Trust advise
the Trustee, the Applicable Lessee and DTC through DTC Participants in writing
that the continuation of a book-entry system through DTC (or a successor
thereto) is no longer in the Certificate Owners' best interest.
 
  Upon the occurrence of any event described in the immediately preceding
paragraph, the Trustee will be required to notify all Certificate Owners
through DTC Participants of the availability of Definitive Certificates. Upon
surrender by DTC of the global certificates representing the Certificates and
receipt of instructions for re-registration, the Trustee will reissue the
Certificates as Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners.
 
                                      11

 
  Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to
Certificates will thereafter be made by the Trustee directly in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Basic Agreement and the applicable Trust
Supplements, to holders in whose names the Definitive Certificates were
registered at the close of business on the applicable record date. Such
distributions will be made by check mailed to the address of such holder as it
appears on the register maintained by the Trustee. The final payment on any
Certificate, however, will be made only upon presentation and surrender of
such Certificate at the office or agency specified in the notice of final
distribution to Certificateholders.
 
  Definitive Certificates will be freely transferable and exchangeable at the
office of the Trustee upon compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Basic Agreement and the applicable Trust Supplements. No service charge will
be imposed for any registration of transfer or exchange, but payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge shall be required.
 
PAYMENTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
 
  Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the
Secured Notes held in each Pass Through Trust will be distributed by the
Trustee, upon receipt, to Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust on the
dates and in the currency specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement,
except in certain cases when some or all of such Secured Notes are in default
as described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. Payments of principal
of, and interest on, the Secured Notes held in each Pass Through Trust will be
scheduled to be received by the Trustee on the dates specified in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement (such scheduled payments of interest and
principal on the Secured Notes to the Trustee are herein referred to as
"Scheduled Payments," and the dates specified in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement for distribution of Scheduled Payments by the Trustee are herein
referred to as "Regular Distribution Dates"). Each Certificateholder of each
Pass Through Trust will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of any
distribution in respect of Scheduled Payments of principal and interest made
on the Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust. The Regular Distribution
Dates on which, and the amounts in which, Scheduled Payments of principal on
the Secured Notes held in each Pass Through Trust are payable will be set
forth in the accompanying Prospectus Supplement.
 
  Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest received by the Trustee
on account of the redemption or purchase, if any, of any of the Secured Notes
held in a Pass Through Trust, and payments received by the Trustee following
an Event of Default (as defined below) in respect of any of the Secured Notes
held in a Pass Through Trust (including payments received by the Trustee on
account of the purchase by the related Owner Trustees or Owner Participants of
such Secured Notes or payments received on account of the sale of such Secured
Notes by the Trustee) ("Special Payments") will be distributed on a date or
dates described in the accompanying Prospectus Supplement (each, a "Special
Distribution Date"). The Trustee will mail notice to the Certificateholders of
record of the related Pass Through Trust not less than 20 days prior to the
Special Distribution Date on which any Special Payment is scheduled to be
distributed by the Trustee in the event the Secured Notes are to be redeemed
or purchased prior to their maturity and, in all other instances, as soon as
practicable after the Trustee has received the Special Payment. The notice
will specify the anticipated Special Distribution Date, the amount of such
anticipated Special Payment, the reason for the Special Payment and the total
amount to be distributed if such Special Distribution Date is the same date as
a Regular Distribution Date. Each distribution of a Special Payment, other
than a final distribution, on a Special Distribution Date for a Pass Through
Trust will be made by the Trustee to the Certificateholders of such Pass
Through Trust on the record date prior to such Special Distribution Date.
 
  The Basic Agreement requires that the Trustee establish and maintain, for
the benefit of the Certificateholders of each Pass Through Trust, one or more
non-interest bearing accounts (with respect to each such Pass Through Trust,
the "Certificate Account") for the deposit of payments
 
                                      12

 
representing Scheduled Payments on the Secured Notes held in the related Pass
Through Trust. The Basic Agreement also requires that the Trustee establish
and maintain, for the benefit of the Certificateholders of each Pass Through
Trust, one or more non-interest bearing accounts (with respect to each such
Pass Through Trust, the "Special Payments Account") for the deposit of
payments representing Special Payments. Pursuant to the terms of the Basic
Agreement, the Trustee is required to deposit any Scheduled Payments on the
Secured Notes held in the applicable Pass Through Trust received by it in the
Certificate Account for such Pass Through Trust and to deposit any Special
Payments so received by it in the Special Payments Account for such Pass
Through Trust. All amounts so deposited will be distributed by the Trustee on
a Regular Distribution Date or a Special Distribution Date, as the case may
be, to the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust.
 
  If any Regular Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date is not a
business day, distributions scheduled to be made on such Regular Distribution
Date or Special Distribution Date may be made on the next succeeding business
day without interest.
 
POOL FACTORS
 
  Unless there has been an early redemption, or a purchase of one or more of
the Secured Notes held in a Pass Through Trust by the related Owner Trustee or
Owner Participant after an Indenture Event of Default (as defined below), a
default in the payment of principal in respect of one or more issues of the
Secured Notes held in a Pass Through Trust or certain actions have been taken
following a default thereon, as described in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement, the Pool Factor (as defined below) for each Pass Through Trust
will decline in proportion to the scheduled repayments of principal on the
Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust as described in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. In the event of such redemption, purchase or default,
the Pool Factor and the Pool Balance (as defined below) of each Pass Through
Trust so affected will be recomputed after giving effect thereto and notice
thereof will be mailed to the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust.
Each Pass Through Trust will have a separate Pool Factor.
 
  Unless otherwise described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
"Pool Balance" for each Pass Through Trust indicates, as of any Regular
Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date, the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust on such date plus
any amounts in respect of principal on such Secured Notes held by the Trustee
and not yet distributed. The Pool Balance for each Pass Through Trust as of
any Regular Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date shall be computed
after giving effect to the payment of principal, if any, on the Secured Notes
held in such Pass Through Trust and the distribution thereof to be made on
that date.
 
  Unless otherwise described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
"Pool Factor" for each Pass Through Trust as of any Regular Distribution Date
or Special Distribution Date is the quotient (rounded to the seventh decimal
place) computed by dividing (i) the then outstanding Pool Balance by (ii) the
aggregate original principal amount of the Certificates issued by such Pass
Through Trust. The Pool Factor for each Pass Through Trust as of any Regular
Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date shall be computed after giving
effect to the payment of principal, if any, on the Secured Notes held in such
Pass Through Trust and distribution thereof to be made on that date. The Pool
Factor for each Pass Through Trust will initially be 1.0000000; thereafter,
the Pool Factor for each Pass Through Trust will decline as described above to
reflect reductions in the Pool Balance of such Pass Through Trust. The amount
of a Certificateholder's pro rata share of the Pool Balance of a Pass Through
Trust can be determined by multiplying the original denomination of the
holder's Certificate of such Pass Through Trust by the Pool Factor for such
Pass Through Trust as of the applicable Regular Distribution Date or Special
Distribution Date. The Pool Factor and the Pool Balance for each Pass Through
Trust will be mailed to Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust on each
Regular Distribution Date and Special Distribution Date.
 
                                      13

 
REPORTS TO CERTIFICATEHOLDERS
 
  On each Regular Distribution Date and Special Distribution Date, the Trustee
will include with each distribution of a Scheduled Payment or Special Payment
to Certificateholders of the related Pass Through Trust a statement, giving
effect to such distribution to be made on such Regular Distribution Date or
Special Distribution Date, as the case may be, setting forth the following
information (per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Certificate for such
Pass Through Trust, as to (i) and (ii) below):
 
    (i) the amount of such distribution allocable to principal and the amount
  allocable to premium, if any;
 
    (ii) the amount of such distribution allocable to interest; and
 
    (iii) the Pool Balance and the Pool Factor for such Pass Through Trust.
 
  So long as the Certificates are registered in the name of Cede, as nominee
for DTC, on the record date prior to each Regular Distribution Date and
Special Distribution Date, the Trustee will request from DTC a Securities
Position Listing setting forth the names of all DTC Participants reflected on
DTC's books as holding interests in the Certificates on such record date. On
each Regular Distribution Date and Special Distribution Date, the Trustee will
mail to each such DTC Participant the statement described above and will make
available additional copies as requested by such DTC Participant for
forwarding to Certificate Owners.
 
  In addition, after the end of each calendar year, the Trustee will prepare
for each Certificateholder of each Pass Through Trust at any time during the
preceding calendar year a report containing the sum of the amounts determined
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above with respect to the Pass Through Trust
for such calendar year or, in the event such person was a Certificateholder
during only a portion of such calendar year, for the applicable portion of
such calendar year, and such other items as are readily available to the
Trustee and which a Certificateholder shall reasonably request as necessary
for the purpose of such Certificateholder's preparation of its federal income
tax returns. Such report and such other items shall be prepared on the basis
of information supplied to the Trustee by the DTC Participants and shall be
delivered by the Trustee to such DTC Participants to be available for
forwarding by such DTC Participants to Certificate Owners in the manner
described above.
 
  At such time, if any, as the Certificates are issued in the form of
Definitive Certificates, the Trustee will prepare and deliver the information
described above to each Certificateholder of record of each Pass Through Trust
as the name and period of beneficial ownership of such Certificateholder
appears on the records of the registrar of the Certificates.
 
VOTING OF SECURED NOTES
 
  The Trustee, as holder of the Secured Notes held in a Pass Through Trust,
will have the right to vote and give consents and waivers with respect to such
Secured Notes under the related Indenture. The Basic Agreement and related
Trust Supplement will set forth (i) the circumstances in which a Trustee may
direct any action or cast any vote, as the holder of the Secured Notes held in
the applicable Pass Through Trust, in its own discretion, (ii) the
circumstances in which such Trustee shall seek instructions from the
Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust and (iii) the percentage of
Certificateholders required to direct such Trustee to take any such action.
 
EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND CERTAIN RIGHTS UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT
 
  The Basic Agreement defines an event of default with respect to a Trust (an
"Event of Default") as the occurrence and continuance of an event of default
under one or more of the related Indentures
 
                                      14

 
(an "Indenture Event of Default"). The Prospectus Supplement for a series of
Certificates will specify the Indenture Events of Default under the related
Indentures. Certain of the Indenture Events of Default will arise with
reference to events of default under the relevant Lease (a "Lease Event of
Default"). Since the Secured Notes issued under an Indenture may be held in
more than one Pass Through Trust, a continuing Indenture Event of Default
under such Indenture would result in an Event of Default under each Pass
Through Trust holding such Secured Notes. Unless otherwise provided in a
Prospectus Supplement, all of the Secured Notes issued under the same
Indenture will relate only to specified Leased Property, there will be no
cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions in the Indentures, and
events resulting in an Indenture Event of Default under any particular
Indenture will not necessarily result in an Indenture Event of Default
occurring under any other Indentures. If an Indenture Event of Default occurs
in fewer than all of the Indentures related to a Pass Through Trust,
notwithstanding the treatment of Secured Notes issued under any related
Indenture under which an Indenture Event of Default has occurred, payments of
principal and interest on the Secured Notes issued pursuant to any related
Indenture with respect to which an Indenture Event of Default has not occurred
will continue to be made as originally scheduled.
 
  The ability of the applicable Owner Trustee or Owner Participant under the
related Indenture to cure Indenture Events of Default, including Indenture
Events of Default that result from the occurrence of a Lease Event of Default
under the related Lease, will be described in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement.
 
  The ability of the Certificateholders with respect to any one Pass Through
Trust to cause the Indenture Trustee with respect to any Secured Notes held in
such Pass Through Trust to accelerate the Secured Notes under the related
Indenture or to direct the exercise of remedies by the Indenture Trustee under
the related Indenture will depend, in part, upon the proportion between the
aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes outstanding under such
Indenture and held in such Pass Through Trust and the aggregate principal
amount of all Secured Notes outstanding under such Indenture. If Secured Notes
outstanding under an Indenture are held by more than one Pass Through Trust,
then each Pass Through Trust will hold Secured Notes with different terms from
the Secured Notes held in the other Pass Through Trusts and therefore the
Certificateholders of a Pass Through Trust may have divergent or conflicting
interests from those of the Certificateholders of the other Pass Through
Trusts holding Secured Notes relating to the same Indenture. In addition, so
long as the same institution acts as Trustee of each Pass Through Trust, in
the absence of instructions from the Certificateholders of any such Pass
Through Trust, the Trustee for such Pass Through Trust could for the same
reason be faced with a potential conflict of interest upon an Indenture Event
of Default. In such event, the Basic Agreement will provide that the Trustee
will resign as trustee of one or all such Pass Through Trusts, and a successor
trustee will be appointed in accordance with the terms of the Basic Agreement.
 
  As an additional remedy, if an Indenture Event of Default under an Indenture
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Basic Agreement provides that the
Trustee of a Pass Through Trust holding Secured Notes issued under such
Indenture may, and upon the direction of the holders of Certificates
evidencing fractional undivided interests aggregating not less than a majority
in interest of such Pass Through Trust shall, sell all or part of such Secured
Notes for cash to any person. Any proceeds received by the Trustee upon any
such sale shall be deposited in the Special Payments Account for the
Certificateholders of such series and shall be distributed to the
Certificateholders of the related Pass Through Trust on a Special Distribution
Date. The market for Secured Notes in default may be very limited, and there
can be no assurance that they could be sold for a reasonable price.
Furthermore, so long as the same institution acts as Trustee of multiple Pass
Through Trusts, it may be faced with a conflict in deciding from which Pass
Through Trust to sell Secured Notes to available buyers. If the Trustee sells
any such Secured Notes with respect to which an Indenture Event of Default
exists for less than their outstanding principal amount, the
Certificateholders of such Pass
 
                                      15

 
Through Trust will receive a smaller amount of principal distributions than
anticipated and will not have any claim for the shortfall against Mobil, any
Lessee, any Owner Trustee, any Owner Participant or the Trustee. Furthermore,
neither the Trustee nor the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust
could take any action with respect to any remaining Secured Notes held in such
Pass Through Trust so long as no Indenture Events of Default exist with
respect thereto.
 
  Any amount, other than Scheduled Payments received on a Regular Distribution
Date, distributed to the Trustee of any Pass Through Trust by the Indenture
Trustee under any Indenture on account of the Secured Notes held in such Pass
Through Trust following an Indenture Event of Default under such Indenture
shall be deposited in the Special Payments Account for such Pass Through Trust
and shall be distributed to the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust
on a Special Distribution Date. In addition, if a Prospectus Supplement
provides that the applicable Owner Trustee or Owner Participant may, under
circumstances specified therein, redeem or purchase the outstanding Secured
Notes issued under the related Indenture, the price paid by such Owner Trustee
or Owner Participant to the Trustee of any Pass Through Trust for the Secured
Notes issued under such Indenture and held in such Pass Through Trust shall be
deposited in the Special Payments Account for such Pass Through Trust and
shall be distributed to the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust on a
Special Distribution Date.
 
  Any funds representing payments received with respect to any Secured Notes
in default held in a Pass Through Trust, or the proceeds from the sale by the
Trustee of any such Secured Notes, held by the Trustee in the Special Payments
Account for such Pass Through Trust shall, to the extent practicable, be
invested and reinvested by the Trustee in Permitted Investments pending the
distribution of such funds on a Special Distribution Date. "Permitted
Investments" are obligations of the United States maturing in not more than 60
days or such lesser time as is required for the distribution of any such funds
on a Special Distribution Date.
 
  The Basic Agreement will provide that the Trustee of a Pass Through Trust
shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of a default in respect of such
Pass Through Trust, give to the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust
notice, transmitted by mail, of all uncured or unwaived defaults with respect
to such Pass Through Trust known to it, provided that, except in the case of
default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on any of
the Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust, the Trustee shall be
protected in withholding such notice if it in good faith determines that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of such Certificateholders. The
term "default" as used in this paragraph only means the occurrence of an Event
of Default with respect to a Pass Through Trust as described above, except
that in determining whether any such Event of Default has occurred, any grace
period or notice in connection therewith shall be disregarded.
 
  The Basic Agreement contains a provision entitling the Trustee of each Pass
Through Trust, subject to the duty of the Trustee during a default to act with
the required standard of care, to be offered reasonable security or indemnity
by the Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust before proceeding to
exercise any right or power under the Basic Agreement at the request of such
Certificateholders.
 
  In certain cases, the holders of Certificates of a Pass Through Trust
evidencing fractional undivided interests aggregating not less than a majority
in interest of such Pass Through Trust may on behalf of the holders of all
Certificates of such Pass Through Trust waive any past default or Event of
Default with respect to such Pass Through Trust and its consequences, except
(i) a default in payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
any of the Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust and (ii) a default in
respect of any covenant or provision of the Basic Agreement or the related
Trust Supplement that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
each Certificateholder of such Pass Through Trust affected thereby. Each
Indenture will provide that, with certain exceptions, the holders of a
majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Secured
 
                                      16

 
Notes issued thereunder and held in a related Pass Through Trust may on behalf
of all such holders waive any past default or Indenture Event of Default
thereunder. In the event of a waiver with respect to a Pass Through Trust as
described above, the principal amount of the Secured Notes issued under the
related Indenture held in such Pass Through Trust shall be counted as waived
in the determination of the majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Secured Notes required to waive a default or an Indenture Event of Default
under such Indenture. Therefore, if the Certificateholders of a Pass Through
Trust or Pass Through Trusts waive a past default or Event of Default such
that the principal amount of the Secured Notes held either individually in
such Pass Through Trust or in the aggregate in such Pass Through Trusts
constitutes the required majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount under
the applicable Indenture, such past default or Indenture Event of Default
under such Indenture shall be waived.
 
MODIFICATIONS OF THE BASIC AGREEMENT
 
  The Basic Agreement contains provisions permitting Mobil, the Applicable
Lessee or Applicable Lessees and the Trustee of each Pass Through Trust to
enter into a supplemental trust agreement, without the consent of the holders
of any of the Certificates of such Pass Through Trust, (i) to provide for the
formation of such Pass Through Trust and the issuance of a series of
Certificates, (ii) to evidence the succession of another corporation to Mobil
or a Lessee and the assumption by such corporation of Mobil's or such Lessee's
obligations with respect to one or more series of Certificates under the Basic
Agreement and the applicable Trust Supplement, (iii) to add to the covenants
of Mobil or a Lessee for the benefit of holders of such Certificates, or to
surrender any right or power in the Basic Agreement conferred upon Mobil or a
Lessee, (iv) to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any defective or
inconsistent provision of the Basic Agreement or the applicable Trust
Supplement or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or
questions arising under the Basic Agreement as may be necessary or desirable,
provided such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders
of such Certificates, or to correct any mistake, (v) to modify, eliminate or
add to the provisions of the Basic Agreement or the applicable Trust
Supplement to the extent as shall be necessary to continue the qualification
of the Basic Agreement (including any supplemental agreement) under the Trust
Indenture Act and to add to the Basic Agreement such other provisions as may
be expressly permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, (vi) to provide for a
successor Trustee or to add to or change any provision of the Basic Agreement
or the applicable Trust Supplement as shall be necessary to facilitate the
administration of the Pass Through Trusts thereunder by more than one Trustee,
(vii) to correct or supplement the description of any property constituting
property of such Pass Through Trust and (viii) to make any other amendments or
modifications to the Basic Agreement or applicable Trust Supplement, provided
such amendments or modifications shall only apply to Certificates issued
thereafter.
 
  The Basic Agreement also contains provisions permitting Mobil, the
Applicable Lessee or Applicable Lessees and the Trustee of a related Pass
Through Trust, with the consent of the Certificateholders of such Pass Through
Trust evidencing fractional undivided interests aggregating not less than a
majority in interest of such Pass Through Trust, and, with respect to any
Leased Property, with the consent of the applicable Owner Trustee (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to execute supplemental trust
agreements adding any provisions to or changing or eliminating any of the
provisions of the Basic Agreement, to the extent relating to such Pass Through
Trust and the applicable Trust Supplement, or modifying the rights of the
Certificateholders, except that no such supplemental trust agreement may,
without the consent of each Certificateholder so affected thereby, (a) reduce
in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, any receipt by the
Trustee of payments on the Secured Notes held in such Pass Through Trust or
distributions in respect of any Certificate related to such Pass Through
Trust, or change the date or place of any payment in respect of any such
Certificate, or make distributions payable in coin or currency other than that
provided for in such Certificates, or impair the right of any
Certificateholder of such Pass Through
 
                                      17

 
Trust to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment when due, (b)
permit the disposition of any Secured Note held in such Pass Through Trust,
except as provided in the Basic Agreement or the applicable Trust Supplement,
or otherwise deprive any Certificateholder of the benefit of the ownership of
the applicable Secured Notes, (c) reduce the percentage of the aggregate
fractional undivided interests of such Pass Through Trust provided for in the
Basic Agreement or the applicable Trust Supplement, the consent of the holders
of which is required for any such supplemental trust agreement or for any
waiver provided for in the Basic Agreement or such Trust Supplement, or (d)
modify any of the provisions relating to the rights of the Certificateholders
in respect of the waiver of events of default or receipt of payment except to
increase the percentage of the aggregate fractional undivided interests of
such Pass Through Trust required for such a waiver.
 
MODIFICATION OF INDENTURE AND RELATED AGREEMENTS
 
  In the event that the Trustee, as the holder of any Secured Notes held in a
Pass Through Trust, receives a request for its consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver under the Lease or other document relating to such
Secured Notes, the Trustee shall mail a notice of such proposed amendment,
modification or waiver to each Certificateholder of such Pass Through Trust as
of the date of such notice. The Trustee shall request instructions from the
Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust as to whether or not to consent
to such amendment, modification or waiver. The Trustee shall vote or consent
with respect to such Secured Notes in such Past Through Trust in the same
proportion as the Certificates of such Pass Through Trust were actually voted
by the holders thereof by a certain date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an
Event of Default in respect of such Pass Through Trust shall have occurred and
be continuing, the Trustee may in its own discretion consent to such
amendment, modification or waiver, and may so notify the Indenture Trustee to
which such consent relates.
 
TERMINATION OF THE PASS THROUGH TRUSTS
 
  The obligations of Mobil, the Applicable Lessee and the Trustee with respect
to a Pass Through Trust will terminate upon the distribution to the
Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust of all amounts required to be
distributed to them pursuant to the Basic Agreement and the applicable Trust
Supplement and the disposition of all property held in such Pass Through
Trust. The Trustee will send to each Certificateholder of record of such Pass
Through Trust notice of the termination of such Pass Through Trust, the amount
of the proposed final payment and the proposed date for the distribution of
such final payment for such Pass Through Trust. The final distribution to any
Certificateholder of such Pass Through Trust will be made only upon surrender
of such Certificateholder's Certificates at the office or agency of the
Trustee specified in such notice of termination.
 
DELAYED PURCHASE
 
  A Prospectus Supplement may specify that, pending availability of some or
all of the Secured Notes intended to be purchased with the proceeds of an
issuance of Certificates, such proceeds may, as more fully described in such
Prospectus Supplement, be (a) invested by the Trustee in United States
government obligations or certain other limited investments described in such
Prospectus Supplement ("Specified Investments"), in which event Mobil or the
Applicable Lessee would be responsible for paying to the Trustee amounts equal
to any loss on such investments and any deficiency in the earnings of such
investments under the amount scheduled to be distributed on such Certificates
in respect of interest and would be entitled to receive any earnings on such
investments in excess of the amount so needed for distribution on the
Certificates, or (b) used by the Trustee to acquire debt instruments issued on
an interim basis by Mobil or by one or more of the Applicable Lessees and
guaranteed by Mobil, in each case having an interest rate and payment
provisions corresponding to the interest rate and payment provisions of the
Secured Notes intended to be
 
                                      18

 
purchased with such proceeds and requiring repayment to the Trustee at the
time the Trustee is to purchase such Secured Notes. Any such debt instruments
will be secured by a collateral account that may be invested in Specified
Investments or by other security described in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement.
 
  To the extent that the full amount of the proceeds from the sale of any
Certificates is not used to purchase Secured Notes on or prior to the date set
forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, an amount equal to the unused
proceeds will be distributed by the Trustee to the holders of record of such
Certificates on a pro rata basis on a Special Distribution Date, together with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate applicable to such Certificates,
but without premium.
 
THE TRUSTEE
 
  Except as otherwise provided in the Prospectus Supplement, State Street Bank
and Trust Company will be the Trustee for each of the Pass Through Trusts.
With certain exceptions, the Trustee will make no representations as to the
validity or sufficiency of the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplements, the
Certificates, the Secured Notes, the Indentures, the Leases or other related
documents. The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any series of
Certificates for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
in accordance with the direction of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of outstanding Certificates of such series. Subject to such provisions,
such Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or
powers under the Basic Agreement at the request of any holders of Certificates
issued thereunder unless they shall have offered to the Trustee indemnity
satisfactory to it. The Basic Agreement provides that the Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity may acquire and hold Certificates issued
thereunder and, subject to certain conditions, may otherwise deal with Mobil
and the Lessees and, with respect to the Leased Property, with any Owner
Trustee and Owner Participant with the same rights it would have if it were
not the Trustee.
 
  The Trustee may resign with respect to any or all of the Pass Through Trusts
at any time, in which event Mobil and the Applicable Lessee will be obligated
to appoint a successor trustee. If the Trustee ceases to be eligible to
continue as Trustee with respect to a Pass Through Trust or becomes incapable
of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent, Mobil and the Applicable Lessee may
remove such Trustee, or any Certificateholder of such Pass Through Trust for
at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly
situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of such
Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee. Any resignation or removal
of the Trustee with respect to a Pass Through Trust and appointment of a
successor trustee for such Pass Through Trust does not become effective until
acceptance of the appointment by the successor trustee. Pursuant to such
resignation and successor trustee provisions, it is possible that a different
trustee could be appointed to act as the successor trustee with respect to
each Pass Through Trust related to a single offering of Certificates. All
references in this Prospectus to the Trustee should be read to take into
account the possibility that the Pass Through Trusts could have different
successor trustees in the event of such a resignation or removal.
 
  The Basic Agreement provides that Mobil or the Applicable Lessee will pay
the Trustee's fees and expenses and indemnify the Trustee against certain
liabilities.
 
                                      19

 
                       DESCRIPTION OF THE SECURED NOTES
 
  The statements made under this caption are summaries and do not purport to
be complete. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by, and reference
is made to, the entire Prospectus and detailed information appearing in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
  To the extent that any provision in any Prospectus Supplement is
inconsistent with any provision in this summary, the provision of such
Prospectus Supplement will control.
 
GENERAL
 
  All Secured Notes related to a Leased Property and held in a Pass Through
Trust will be issued under a separate Indenture between the related Owner
Trustee of an Owner Trust for the benefit of the related Owner Participant,
and the related Indenture Trustee. Such Secured Notes will be nonrecourse
obligations of the applicable Owner Trust. Each such Secured Note will be
authenticated under an Indenture by the Indenture Trustee.
 
  With respect to each Leased Property, the related Owner Trustee has acquired
or will acquire such Leased Property and, unless otherwise provided in the
Prospectus Supplement, has granted or will grant a lien on and a security
interest in such Leased Property to the related Indenture Trustee as security
for the payments of the related Secured Notes, and has leased or will lease
such Leased Property to the Applicable Lessee pursuant to the related Lease
which has been or will be assigned to the related Indenture Trustee. Pursuant
to each such Lease, the Applicable Lessee will be obligated to make or cause
to be made rental and other payments to the related Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the related Owner Trustee in amounts that will be sufficient to make
payments of the principal and interest and, except in the limited
circumstances set forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, premium, if
any, due in respect of such Secured Notes when and as due and payable.
 
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS
 
  Interest received by the Trustee on the Secured Notes held in each Pass
Through Trust will be passed through to the Certificateholders of such Pass
Through Trust on the dates and at the rate per annum set forth in the
applicable Prospectus Supplement until the final distribution date for such
Pass Through Trust. Principal received by the Trustee on the Secured Notes
held in each Pass Through Trust will be passed through to the
Certificateholders of such Pass Through Trust in scheduled amounts on the
dates set forth in the applicable Prospectus Supplement until the final
distribution date for such Pass Through Trust.
 
  If any date scheduled for any payment of principal, premium, if any, or
interest with respect to the Secured Notes is not a business day, such payment
will be made on the next succeeding business day without any additional
interest.
 
REDEMPTION
 
  The applicable Prospectus Supplement will describe the circumstances,
whether voluntary or involuntary, under which the Secured Notes may be
redeemed or purchased prior to the stated maturity date thereof, in whole or
in part, the premium, if any, applicable upon certain redemptions or purchases
and other terms applying to the redemptions or purchases of such Secured
Notes.
 
SECURITY
 
  The Secured Notes to be held in the Pass Through Trusts will be secured by
(i) an assignment by the related Owner Trustee to the related Indenture
Trustee of such Owner Trustee's rights (except for certain rights, including
those described below) under the Lease or Leases with respect to the
 
                                      20

 
related Leased Property including the right to receive payments of rent
thereunder, (ii) an assignment of certain of such Owner Trustee's rights under
the Parent Guaranty relating to such Leased Property, and (iii) to the extent
provided in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, a mortgage or other security
interest in such Leased Property or in construction contracts or other
agreements, collateral accounts or other security, in each case subject to the
rights of the Lessee under the Lease related thereto and other rights, if any,
described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.
 
  Under the terms of each Lease, the Applicable Lessee's obligations in
respect of the related Leased Property will be those of a lessee under a "net
lease." Accordingly, such Lessee will be obligated, among other things, to pay
all costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the Leased Property. With
respect to the Leased Property, the assignment by the related Owner Trustee to
the related Indenture Trustee of its rights under the related Lease will
exclude, among other things, rights of such Owner Trustee and the related
Owner Participant relating to indemnification by such Lessee for certain
matters, insurance proceeds payable to such Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity and to such Owner Participant under liability insurance maintained by
such Lessee pursuant to such Lease or by such Owner Trustee or such Owner
Participant, insurance proceeds payable to such Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity or to such Owner Participant under certain casualty
insurance maintained by such Owner Trustee or such Owner Participant pursuant
to such Lease and any rights of such Owner Participant or such Owner Trustee
to enforce payment of the foregoing amounts and their respective rights to the
proceeds of the foregoing. Such rights excluded from the assignment shall be
referred to as "Excepted Payments."
 
  The applicable Prospectus Supplement will specify the required insurance
coverage, if any, with respect to the Leased Property.
 
  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
Secured Notes will not be cross-collateralized and consequently the Secured
Notes issued in respect of any Leased Property will not be secured by any
other Leased Property or the Lease related thereto. Unless and until an
Indenture Event of Default with respect to a Leased Property has occurred and
is continuing, the related Indenture Trustee may exercise only limited rights
of the related Owner Trustee under the related Lease.
 
  Funds, if any, held from time to time by the Indenture Trustee with respect
to any Leased Property, prior to the distribution thereof, will be invested
and reinvested by such Indenture Trustee. Such investment and reinvestment
will be at the direction of the Applicable Lessee, as agent for the related
Owner Trustee (except in the case of a related Lease Event of Default under
the applicable Lease) in certain investments described in the related
Indenture. The net amount of any loss resulting from any such investments will
be paid by such Lessee, as agent for such Owner Trustee.
 
ADDITIONAL NOTES
 
  Under certain circumstances and conditions as described in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement, for the purpose of providing funds to finance the cost
of certain modifications, alterations, additions, improvements or replacement
parts to any particular item of Leased Property, a Lessee may cause the
financing of such additional costs through the issuance and sale by the Owner
Trustee of additional Secured Notes (the "Additional Notes").
 
  The terms, conditions and designations of such Additional Notes will be set
forth in a supplement to the related Indenture. All rent and other amounts
payable by the Applicable Lessee under the related Lease will be adjusted to
the extent necessary to provide for rent and other amounts sufficient to
provide for the payment, when due, of all scheduled payments of principal of,
premium (except for those instances where such Lessee shall not be responsible
for such premium), if any, and interest on the Secured Notes, including the
Additional Notes so issued.
 
                                      21

 
PAYMENTS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 
  Each Leased Property will be leased by the applicable Owner Trustee to the
Applicable Lessee pursuant to a Lease for a term commencing not later than the
delivery date thereof to such Owner Trustee and expiring on a date not earlier
than the latest maturity date of the related Secured Notes, unless previously
terminated as permitted by the terms of such Lease. The basic rent or hire and
other payments under each such Lease will be payable by the Applicable Lessee
in accordance with the terms specified in such Lease and will be described in
the applicable Prospectus Supplement, and (other than Excepted Payments) will
be assigned by the applicable Owner Trustee under the applicable Indenture to
an Indenture Trustee to provide the funds necessary to pay principal and
interest and, except in the limited circumstances set forth in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement, premium, if any, due in respect of the Secured Notes
issued under such Indenture. In certain cases, the basic rent payments under a
Lease may be adjusted, but each Lease will provide that under no circumstances
will the rental payments which the Applicable Lessee is obligated to make or
cause to be made be less than the scheduled payments of principal and interest
on the related Secured Notes. The balance of any basic rent payment under each
Lease, after payment of amounts due on the Secured Notes issued under the
Indenture corresponding to such Lease, will be paid over to the applicable
Owner Trustee. The Applicable Lessee's obligation to pay rent and to cause
other payments to be made under each Lease will be general obligations of such
Lessee.
 
  Except in certain circumstances involving a Lessee's purchase of Leased
Property and the assumption of the Secured Notes related thereto, the Secured
Notes will not be obligations of, or guaranteed by, any Lessee or Mobil. None
of the Owner Trustees, the Owner Participants or the Indenture Trustees shall
be personally liable to any holder of such Secured Notes for amounts payable
under such Secured Notes, or, except as provided in the Indentures relating
thereto in the case of the Owner Trustees and the Indenture Trustees, for any
liability under such Indentures. Except in the circumstances referred to
above, all amounts payable under any Secured Notes (other than payments made
in connection with an optional redemption or purchase by the related Owner
Trustee or the related Owner Participant) will be made only from the assets
subject to the lien of the related Indenture with respect to such Leased
Property or the income and proceeds received by the related Indenture Trustee
therefrom (including rent payable by the Applicable Lessee under the related
Lease).
 
  Except as otherwise provided in the related Indentures, no Owner Trustee
shall be personally liable for any amount payable or for any statements,
representations, warranties, agreements or obligations under such Indentures
or under the Secured Notes except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. None of the Owner Participants shall have any duty or
responsibility under the Indentures or under such Secured Notes to the related
Indenture Trustee or to any holder of any such Secured Note.
 
MERGER, CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSFER OF ASSETS
 
  Each Lessee and Mobil is prohibited from consolidating with or merging into
any other corporation or transferring substantially all of its assets to
another corporation unless such Lessee or Mobil, as the case may be, is the
continuing corporation or, among other things, (a) the successor corporation
shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United
States or any State or the District of Columbia or, in the case of Mobil, any
other jurisdiction, and (b) the successor corporation shall expressly assume
the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and
conditions of the operative documents to which such Lessee or Mobil, as the
case may be, is a party and which are to be performed thereby.
 
                                      22

 
DEFEASANCE OF THE INDENTURES AND THE SECURED NOTES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
 
  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
applicable Indenture will provide that the obligations of the related
Indenture Trustee and the related Owner Trustee in respect of any series of
Secured Notes issued in accordance with the terms of such Indenture shall be
deemed to have been discharged and paid in full (except for certain
obligations, including the obligations to register the transfer or exchange of
Secured Notes, to replace stolen, lost, destroyed or mutilated Secured Notes
and to maintain paying agencies and hold money for payment in trust) upon the
irrevocable deposit with the related Indenture Trustee of money or certain
obligations of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof the
payment of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
which, through the payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in
accordance with their terms, will provide money in an aggregate amount
sufficient to pay when due (including as a consequence of redemption in
respect of which notice is given on or prior to the date of such deposit)
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Secured Notes. Such
discharge may occur only if, among other things, there has been published by
the Internal Revenue Service a ruling to the effect that holders of such
Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be
subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at
the same time as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and
discharge had not occurred.
 
  Upon such defeasance, or upon payment in full of the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on all Secured Notes issued under any Indenture on the
maturity date therefor or deposit with the applicable Indenture Trustee of
money sufficient therefor no earlier than one year prior to the date of such
maturity, the holders of such Secured Notes will have no beneficial interest
in or other rights with respect to the related Leased Property or other assets
subject to the lien of such Indenture (other than amounts or obligations
deposited to effect such discharge) and such lien shall terminate.
 
ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS BY LESSEE
 
  A Prospectus Supplement may specify that, with respect to any Leased
Property and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in such
Prospectus Supplement, the Applicable Lessee may, upon the exercise of any
purchase and certain other termination options it may have under the related
Lease, assume on a full recourse basis all of the obligations of the related
Owner Trustee under the Indenture with respect to such Leased Property,
including the obligations to make payments in respect of the related Secured
Notes. In such event, such Lessee shall execute a supplemental indenture to
the related Indenture (such supplemental indenture, together with the related
Indenture, a "Company Indenture"). The Parent Guaranty will continue to apply
to such Lessee's obligations. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement, the Leased Property will continue to be subject to the
lien of the Company Indenture, and the Company Indenture will incorporate
certain relevant provisions of the Lease so terminated, including (among
others) provisions relating to maintenance, possession and use of the related
Leased Property, liens, insurance, possession and events of default.
 
THE PARENT GUARANTIES
 
  As described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, Mobil will
unconditionally guarantee the full and prompt payment of all amounts payable
by the Applicable Lessee under the related Lease when and as the same shall
become due and payable. Each Parent Guaranty will be enforceable without any
need first to enforce any Lease against the Applicable Lessee. Each Parent
Guaranty will be an unsecured obligation of Mobil.

                        FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
  The following is a general discussion of the anticipated material federal
income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
Certificates by a Certificate Owner purchasing Certificates in the initial
offering thereof and should be read in conjunction with any additional
discussion of federal income tax consequences included in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. This summary is based on laws, regulations, rulings and
decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change by legislative,
administrative or judicial action. The discussion below does not purport to
address federal income tax consequences applicable to particular categories of
investors, some of which (for example, insurance companies or foreign
investors) may be subject to special rules. The Pass Through Trusts are not
indemnified for any federal income taxes that may be imposed upon them, and
the imposition of any such taxes could result in a reduction in the amounts
available for distribution to the Certificate Owners of a Pass Through Trust.
In connection with each offering of Certificates, Mobil and the Applicable
Lessee will receive an opinion from Debevoise & Plimpton, or other counsel
specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, that, based upon the
applicable law then in effect, the following discussion, as amended or
supplemented by the applicable Prospectus Supplement, properly describes in
general the anticipated principal United States federal income tax
consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Certificates.
 
  INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL, FOREIGN AND ANY OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE,
OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE CERTIFICATES, INCLUDING THE ADVISABILITY OF
MAKING ANY ELECTION DISCUSSED BELOW, IN LIGHT OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
GENERAL
 
  Based upon an interpretation of analogous authorities under currently
applicable law, each Pass Through Trust will be classified as a grantor trust
(and not as an association taxable as a corporation) and each Certificate
Owner will be treated as the owner of a pro rata undivided interest in the
Secured Notes or any other property held in the applicable Pass Through Trust.
Each Certificate Owner will be required to report on its federal income tax
return its pro rata share of the entire income from the Secured Notes and any
other property in the applicable Pass Through Trust, in accordance with such
Certificate Owner's method of accounting. Thus, a Certificate Owner using the
cash method of accounting will take into account its pro rata share of income
as and when received by the Trustee in respect of the applicable Pass Through
Trust, and a Certificate Owner using an accrual method of accounting will take
into account its pro rata share of income as it accrues or is received by the
Trustee in respect of the applicable Pass Through Trust, whichever is earlier.
 
  If a Pass Through Trust will hold more than one Secured Note, a purchaser of
a Certificate will be treated as purchasing an interest in each Secured Note
and any other property in the related Pass Through Trust at a price determined
by allocating the purchase price paid for the Certificate among such Secured
Notes and other property in proportion to their fair market values at the time
of purchase of the Certificate.
 
SALES OF CERTIFICATES
 
  A Certificate Owner that sells a Certificate will recognize gain or loss (in
the aggregate) equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale
(except to the extent attributable to accrued interest, which will be taxable
as interest income) and the Certificate Owner's adjusted tax basis in the
Certificate. Subject to the market discount provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (described below), any such gain or loss
will be capital gain or loss if the
 
                                      24

 
Certificate was held as a capital asset and, if the Certificate was held for
more than one year, will be long-term capital gain or loss. Any long-term
capital gains realized will be taxable to corporate taxpayers at the rates
applicable to ordinary income and to individual taxpayers at a maximum
marginal rate of 28%. Any capital losses realized will be deductible by a
corporate taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains and by an individual
taxpayer only to the extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income.
 
MARKET DISCOUNT
 
  A purchaser of a Certificate (other than an original purchaser of a
Certificate at the offering price set forth in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement) will be considered to have acquired an interest in a Secured Note
held in the applicable Pass Through Trust at a "market discount" to the extent
the remaining principal amount of such Secured Note allocable to such
Certificate exceeds the purchaser's tax basis allocable to such Secured Note,
unless the excess does not exceed a prescribed de minimis amount. In the event
such excess exceeds the de minimis amount, the Certificate Owner will be
subject to the market discount rules with regard to its interest in the
Secured Note.
 
  In the case of a sale or other disposition of indebtedness subject to the
market discount rules, gain, if any, from such sale or disposition must be
treated as ordinary income to the extent such gain represents market discount
that has accrued during the period in which the indebtedness was held. If such
indebtedness is disposed of in a nontaxable transaction, the accrued market
discount (subject to certain exceptions) will be includible in ordinary income
as if the Certificate Owner had sold the Certificate at its then market value.
 
  In the case of a partial principal payment on indebtedness subject to the
market discount rules, such payment must be included in gross income as
ordinary income to the extent such payment does not exceed the market discount
that has accrued during the period such indebtedness was held. The amount of
any accrued market discount later required to be included in income upon a
disposition or subsequent partial principal payment will be reduced by the
amount of accrued market discount previously included in income.
 
  Generally, market discount accrues under a straight line method, or, at the
election of the taxpayer, under a constant interest method. However, in the
case of amortizing obligations, until Treasury regulations are issued, the
explanatory Conference Committee Report to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the
"Conference Report") indicates that holders of amortizing obligations with
market discount (that do not also have original issue discount) may elect to
accrue market discount either on the basis of a constant interest rate or as
follows: the amount of market discount that is deemed to accrue is the amount
of market discount that bears the same ratio to the total amount of remaining
market discount that the amount of stated interest paid in the accrual period
bears to the total amount of stated interest remaining to be paid on the
amortizing obligation as of the beginning of such period.
 
  If in any taxable year interest paid or accrued on a loan incurred or
continued to purchase or carry indebtedness subject to the market discount
rules exceeds the interest currently includible in income with respect to such
indebtedness, deduction of the excess interest must be deferred to the extent
of the market discount allocable to the taxable year. The deferred portion of
any interest expense will generally be deductible when such market discount is
included in income upon the sale or other disposition (including repayment) of
the indebtedness.
 
  A taxpayer may elect to include market discount in its gross income
currently. If such election is made, the rules described above regarding the
treatment of certain gain as ordinary income and the deferral of interest
expense will not apply to the taxpayer.
 
                                      25

 
PREMIUM
 
  A Certificate Owner generally will be considered to have acquired an
interest in a Secured Note held in the applicable Pass Through Trust at a
premium to the extent the Certificate Owner's tax basis allocable to such
Secured Note exceeds the remaining principal amount of the Secured Note
allocable to such Certificate Owner's Certificate. In that event, a
Certificate Owner who holds such Certificate as a capital asset may elect to
amortize that premium as an offset to interest income with corresponding
reductions in the Certificate Owner's tax basis in its interest in the Secured
Note. This election is made by claiming the bond premium on the Certificate
Owner's tax return. Generally, if the foregoing election is made such
amortization is taken on a constant yield basis. However, in the case of
amortizing obligations, the Conference Report indicates a Congressional intent
that amortization should be in accordance with the same rules that apply to
the accrual of market discount on amortizing obligations. See "Market
Discount."
 
  Under current Treasury regulations, in the case of Secured Notes that may be
called at a premium prior to maturity, amortizable bond premium may be
determined by reference to an early call date. Under proposed Treasury
regulations issued in June 1996, a holder of an obligation that may be called
at a premium prior to maturity generally would not be entitled to determine
the amount of amortizable bond premium by reference to an early call date, but
may be allowed, if an early call occurred, to deduct all or part of any
unamortized bond premium in the year of such call. The proposed regulations
provide that they will apply with respect to debt instruments issued on or
after 60 days following the date final regulations are published in the
Federal Register. Any Prospectus Supplement to which such final regulations
may apply will so indicate.
 
  Due to the complexities of the amortizable premium rules, particularly if
there is more than one possible call date and the amount of any premium is
uncertain, Certificate Owners are urged to consult their own tax advisors as
to the amount of any such amortizable premium and the advisability of making
an amortization election.
 
ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT
 
  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, subject
to the aggregation rules discussed below, the Secured Notes will not be issued
with original issue discount. Under the aggregation rules set forth in the
current Treasury Regulations, if one investor purchases Certificates issued by
more than one Pass Through Trust, certain of that investor's interests in the
Secured Notes in those Trusts must in certain circumstances be treated
together as a single debt instrument, which, for purposes of calculating and
amortizing any original issue discount, has a single issue price, maturity
date, stated redemption price at maturity, and yield to maturity. If such
aggregation rules were applicable to an investor, such Secured Notes could be
treated with respect to such investor as having been issued with original
issue discount. Generally, a holder of a debt instrument issued with original
issue discount that is not de minimis must include such original issue
discount in income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in advance
of the receipt of the cash attributable to such income, under a method that
takes into account the compounding of interest. Certificate Owners are urged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the aggregation
rules.
 
BACKUP WITHHOLDING
 
  Payments made on the Certificates, and proceeds from the sale of the
Certificates to or through certain brokers, may be subject to a "backup"
withholding tax of 31% unless the Certificate Owner complies with certain
reporting procedures or is exempt from such requirements. Any such withheld
amounts are allowed as a credit against the Certificate Owner's federal income
tax and may entitle such Certificate Owner to a refund, provided the required
information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service ("the IRS").
Furthermore, certain penalties may be imposed by the IRS on a Certificate
Owner who is required to supply information but who does not do so in the
proper manner.
 
                                      26

 
                          CERTAIN MASSACHUSETTS TAXES
 
  The Trustee is a Massachusetts trust company with its corporate trust office
at Two International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. Bingham, Dana & Gould
LLP, counsel to the Trustee, has advised Mobil that, in its opinion, under
currently applicable law, assuming that each Pass Through Trust will not be
taxable as a corporation, but, rather, will be classified as a grantor trust
for federal income tax purposes, (i) the Pass Through Trusts will not be
subject to any tax (including, without limitation, net or gross income,
tangible or intangible property, net worth, capital, franchise or doing
business tax), fee or other governmental charge under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any political subdivision thereof, and (ii)
Certificate Owners who are not residents of or otherwise subject to tax in
Massachusetts will not be subject to any tax (including, without limitation,
net or gross income, tangible or intangible property, net worth, capital
franchise or doing business tax), fee or other governmental charge under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any political subdivision thereof
as a result of purchasing, holding (including receiving payments with respect
to) or selling a Certificate. Neither the Pass Through Trusts nor the
Certificate Owners will be indemnified for any state or local taxes imposed on
them, and the imposition of any such taxes on any Pass Through Trust could
result in a reduction in the amounts available for distribution to the
Certificate Owners of such Pass Through Trust. In general, should a
Certificate Owner or a Pass Through Trust be subject to any state or local tax
which would not be imposed if the Trustee were located in a different
jurisdiction in the United States, the Trustee will resign and a new trustee
in such other jurisdiction will be appointed.
 
                             ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
 
  Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
Certificates may, subject to certain legal restrictions, be purchased and held
by an employee benefit plan (a "Plan") subject to Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or an individual
retirement account or an employee benefit plan subject to section 4975 of the
Code. A fiduciary of a Plan must determine that the purchase and holding of a
Certificate is consistent with its fiduciary duties under ERISA and does not
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction as defined in section 406 of
ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. Employee benefit plans which are
governmental plans (as defined in section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain church
plans (as defined in section 3(33) of ERISA) are not subject to Title I of
ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. The Certificates may, subject to certain
legal restrictions, be purchased and held by such plans.
 
                             PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
 
  Certificates may be sold to one or more underwriters for public offering and
sale by them or to investors or other persons directly or through one or more
dealers or agents. Any such underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer
and sale of the Certificates will be named in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement.
 
  The Certificates may be sold at a fixed price or prices, which may be
changed, or from time to time at market prices prevailing at the time of sale,
at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.
Dealer trading may take place in certain of the Certificates, including
Certificates not listed on any securities exchange. Neither Mobil nor the
Lessees intend to apply for listing of the Certificates on a national
securities exchange. Mobil and the Lessees also may, from time to time,
authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and sell the
Certificates upon the terms and conditions as shall be set forth in any
Prospectus Supplement. In connection with the sale of Certificates,
underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from Mobil and the
Applicable Lessee in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and may
also receive
 
                                      27

 
commissions from purchasers of Certificates for whom they may act as agent.
Underwriters may sell Certificates to or through dealers, and such dealers may
receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from
the underwriters and/or commissions (which may be changed from time to time)
from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.
 
  If a dealer is used directly by Mobil or a Lessee in the sale of
Certificates in respect of which this Prospectus is delivered, such
Certificates will be sold to the dealer, as principal. The dealer may then
resell such Certificates to the public at varying prices to be determined by
such dealer at the time of resale. Any such dealer and the terms of any such
sale will be set forth in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto.
 
  Certificates may be offered and sold through agents designated by Mobil and
the Applicable Lessee from time to time. Any such agent involved in the offer
or sale of the Certificates in respect of which this Prospectus is delivered
will be named in, and any commissions payable by Mobil and such Lessee to such
agent will be set forth in, the applicable Prospectus Supplement. Unless
otherwise indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, any such agent
will be acting on a best efforts basis for the period of its appointment.
 
  Offers to purchase Certificates may be solicited directly by Mobil and the
Applicable Lessees and sales thereof may be made by Mobil and the Applicable
Lessees directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be
underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any
resale thereof. The terms of any such sales will be described in the
Prospectus Supplement relating thereto. Except as set forth in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement, no director, officer or employee of Mobil or the
Lessees will solicit or receive a commission in connection with direct sales
by Mobil or the Lessees of the Certificates, although such persons may respond
to inquiries by potential purchasers and perform ministerial and clerical work
in connection with any such direct sales.
 
  Any underwriting compensation paid by Mobil and the Applicable Lessee to
underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of
Certificates, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by
underwriters to participating dealers, will be set forth in an applicable
Prospectus Supplement. Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the
distribution of the Certificates may be deemed to be underwriters, and any
discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on
resale of the Certificates may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and
commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be
entitled, under agreements with Mobil and the Applicable Lessee, to
indemnification against and contribution toward certain civil liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to reimbursement by Mobil
and such Lessee for certain expenses.
 
  Underwriters, dealers and agents and their affiliates may engage in
transactions with, or perform services for, Mobil and its subsidiaries from
time to time.
 
  If so indicated in an applicable Prospectus Supplement and subject to
existing market conditions, Mobil and the Applicable Lessee will authorize
dealers acting as Mobil's and such Lessee's agents to solicit offers by
certain institutions to purchase Certificates at the public offering price set
forth in such Prospectus Supplement pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts
("Contracts") providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated
in such Prospectus Supplement. Each Contract will be for an amount not less
than, and the aggregate principal amount of Certificates sold pursuant to
Contracts shall not be less nor more than, the respective amounts stated in
such Prospectus Supplement. Institutions with whom Contracts, when authorized,
may be made include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension
funds, investment companies, educational and charitable institutions and other
institutions, but will in all cases be subject to the approval of Mobil and
the Applicable Lessee. Contracts will not be subject to any conditions except
 
                                      28

 
the purchase by an institution of the Certificates covered by its Contracts
shall not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any
jurisdiction in the United States to which such institution is subject. A
commission indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement will be granted
to underwriters and agents soliciting purchases of Certificates pursuant to
Contracts accepted by Mobil and the Applicable Lessee. Agents and underwriters
will have no responsibility in respect of the delivery or performance of
Contracts.
 
  If an underwriter or underwriters are utilized in the sale of any
Certificates, the applicable Prospectus Supplement will contain a statement as
to the intention, if any, of such underwriters at the date of such Prospectus
Supplement to make a market in the Certificates. No assurances can be given
that there will be a market for the Certificates.
 
  The place and time of delivery for the Certificates in respect of which this
Prospectus is delivered will be set forth in the applicable Prospectus
Supplement.
 
                                LEGAL OPINIONS
 
  Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the
validity of the Certificates and the Parent Guaranties will be passed upon for
Mobil and the Lessees by Ralph N. Johanson, Jr., Managing Counsel, Corporate,
Finance and Securities of Mobil and by Debevoise & Plimpton, 875 Third Avenue,
New York, New York 10022, and for any agents or underwriters by Shearman &
Sterling, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022. Unless otherwise
indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, Mr. Johanson, Debevoise &
Plimpton and Shearman & Sterling will rely on the opinion of counsel for the
Trustee as to certain matters relating to the authorization, execution and
delivery of such Certificates by, and the valid and binding effect thereof on,
such Trustee.
